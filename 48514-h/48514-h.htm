<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, in offering me the Rhind
lectureship in Archæology for the year 1888, left me no choice of a
subject, as they had already suggested that the course should be on
the "Lake-dwellings of Europe." Their communication embodying this
proposal came upon me with complete surprise, and, indeed, it was with
considerable misgiving that I pondered over the undertaking, because
at that time I had no special knowledge of lake-dwellings beyond
Scotland. But the kind encouragement of friends and the fact that I
had two years to collect the necessary materials, ultimately overcame
my scruples; and so with the acceptance of this appointment the work
now offered to the public may be said to have been begun. My first
and almost immediate step was a hasty run to the principal centres of
lake-dwelling researches in Europe, so as to get a preliminary idea
of the best and most practical way of carrying out this work. It was
only then that the magnitude of the labours I had undertaken dawned
upon me. The relics from the more important settlements, with few
exceptions, were so widely scattered that, to form an intelligible
notion of the civilisation and culture of their inhabitants from a
study of their industrial remains, scores of museums and private
collections had to be visited. Nor was the condition of the literature
and records of the various discoveries more favourable to my purpose.
The successive investigations by different parties in the more
prolific stations were constantly altering the previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
records and, in some instances, even falsified the earlier deductions
founded on them. Again, descriptive notices were directed more to
illustrate the particular and rarer finds of the investigator than to
convey to general readers a fair estimate of the <i>tout-ensemble</i> of
any special station. Keller's earlier reports were really exhaustive
monographs, but by-and-by the subject became so extensive that to
carry out the work on the same scale would entail the publication of
many volumes. In 1866, when Mr. Lee translated and arranged Keller's
first six reports, his work was fairly representative of the progress
then made in lake-dwelling researches; but to keep pace with this
progress a second edition at the end of the following decade assumed
the magnitude of two large volumes.</p>

<p>Since then, however (1878), the results of lacustrine researches
have been greater and more important than during any previous
corresponding period. The "Correction des Eaux du Jura," together with
various harbour alterations in the lakes of Zürich, Geneva, etc., have
been the means of enormously increasing the lacustrine collections
of Switzerland. In North Italy not only have new and remarkably
interesting lacustrine stations been discovered and exhaustively
investigated, as Lagozza and Polada, but the researches in the
terremare have been such as to entirely alter the previous opinions
held in regard to them. Nor has the progress in this field of research
in many other countries in Europe been scarcely less important, in
proof of which I have only to mention the additions made to the
Scottish and Irish crannogs; the curious fascine structures brought
to light in Holderness, Yorkshire; the novel revelations extracted
from the <i>terp</i> mounds in Holland and other low-lying districts on
the coast of the German Ocean; the greatly extended and more accurate
details of lacustrine structures in North Germany; the discovery in
Hungary of prehistoric mounds analogous to the terramara deposits of
Italy, etc. In short there is hardly any corner of the lake-dwelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
area in Europe which has not yielded new materials, throwing more or
less light on this strange phase of prehistoric life.</p>

<p>In these circumstances I resolved to proceed <i>de novo</i>, and to
construct my story of the lake-dwellings from whatever trustworthy
sources I could lay my hands on. In order to carry out this intention
my wife and I perambulated the whole of Central Europe with note and
sketch books in hand, visiting, as far as practicable, the sites
of lake-dwellings, and searching museums and libraries wherever we
thought their relics or records were to be found. The eastern limit
of the region thus visited may be represented by a line drawn from
Königsberg to Trieste, passing through the intermediate towns of
Krakow, Buda-Pesth, and Agram. The materials brought together from
within this area are, to a very considerable extent, absolutely new
to British archæologists. Of course, in a work which aims at putting
into the hands of general readers an epitome of the essential facts
and results of lacustrine researches since these singular remains were
discovered in Europe, I had to take cognisance of some investigations
that have already been fully recorded and illustrated. As it was
impossible to illustrate typical groups of objects from all the
lacustrine stations, I have, as a rule, in selecting the illustrations
for this work, avoided those that have already come within the
reach of English readers through the translation of Keller's works,
except when they belonged to stations that are the best or only
representatives of their kind in their respective localities&mdash;as,
for example, the Rosen Insel in the Lake of Starnberg. Acting on
this principle, I have given very few illustrations of objects from
Nidau, Moosseedorf, St. Aubin, Wauwyl; nor, for the same reason, is
a prominent place given to the earlier discoveries at Robenhausen,
Estavayer, Concise, Cortaillod, etc. In this way I have endeavoured to
combine in the work now issued as much novelty as possible, without
detracting from its general and comprehensive scope.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>As our peripatetic labours drew to a close, the next point to
be considered was the method of grouping the materials under six
divisions, corresponding with the prescribed number of lectures.
This was by no means an easy task, as neither the geographical
distribution, nor the historical order of the discoveries, could be
exclusively selected as a cementing element in dealing with remains
so diversified in character and of so wide a range in space and
time. The plan which I have here adopted seems to me to combine the
greatest advantages with the fewest drawbacks. Its rationale is as
follows:&mdash;After introducing my subject by a short account of
the circumstances that led to the discovery of the <i>Pfahlbauten</i>
in the Lake of Zürich, and glancing at the archæological importance
and surprising results of this discovery in other Swiss lakes, the
historical element is dropped, and I conduct my readers over Western
Switzerland and Savoy, summarising the discoveries in the successive
lakes as we move along. In the second lecture we again start near the
same place and continue our explorations in an easterly direction, and
having examined the Upper Rhine district we cross over to the great
Danubian basin, which we follow downwards as far as the lacustrine
trail carries us, and ultimately finish with Laibach near the source
of the Drave. The third lecture is entirely occupied with the
palafittes and terremare in the Po valley. In these wanderings we have
virtually made a circuit of the great Alpine chain of mountains, and
have seen that the habit of constructing lake-dwellings was prevalent
in the upper reaches of the four principal waterways which diverge
from its flanks, viz. the Rhine, Rhone, Danube, and Po.</p>

<p>The lake-dwelling area thus surveyed comprises all the remains
that can unequivocally be said to belong to the primary development
of these structures in Europe, their period of existence being almost
exclusively confined to the prehistoric ages of Stone and Bronze.
Such being the case, this might be a suitable opportunity for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
offering some general remarks on the culture and civilisation of
their inhabitants; but this I defer to the final lecture, thinking
it preferable before doing so to acquaint my readers with various
details of analogous remains brought to light in other districts in
Europe. Accordingly in the fourth lecture we continue our geographical
wanderings. Again starting in Switzerland we discuss the peculiar
remains found in La Tène, almost the only exception to the ordinary
<i>Pfahlbauten</i> of the Stone and Bronze ages encountered in our previous
tour; and thence, moving northwards by the lower Rhine district, we
pass to North Germany, where we meet with settlements apparently
belonging to all ages. The fifth lecture is exclusively devoted to
an exposition of the crannogs and lake-dwellings within the British
Isles. In these five lectures we have thus surveyed the entire area
in Europe in which the remains of ancient lake-dwellings have been
discovered in modern times.</p>

<p>Excepting the well-known reports of Keller and a few monographs
on particular stations or districts, the entire literature of the
subject may be said to lie buried in the Transactions of learned
societies. Having to hunt up and peruse most of these obscure and
almost inaccessible articles&mdash;the number and extent of which may
be estimated by a glance at the accompanying bibliography&mdash;it
occurred to me that, by tabulating all the works and notices of
these researches in chronological sequence, under the names of their
respective authors and with correct references to their published
sources, I might be conferring some benefit on future investigators,
while supplying myself with a simple and ready means of referring to
authorities, without the necessity of having to repeat over and over
again the voluminous titles of publications. Hence the origin of the
bibliography appended to this work, which, however imperfect, will, I
trust, considerably enhance its value. Its compilation has given me a
great deal of trouble, and the only valuable assistance I derived from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
other publications of the kind was from Pigorini's "Bibliography of
Italian Archæology," which, unfortunately, comes down only to 1874.</p>

<p>There remains now only the pleasant duty of thanking those who
have assisted me in bringing the work, so far, to a satisfactory
conclusion. On this score my obligations are very great.</p>

<p>(1) In collecting the materials on the Continent my work was
greatly facilitated by introductory notes from and to eminent
archæologists, and among those who so honoured me I have especially

<h2>First Lecture.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">SETTLEMENTS IN LAKE ZÜRICH, WESTERN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE.</span></h2>

<p>The investigations of geologists in the early part of this
century, culminating in the publication of Sir Charles Lyell's
"Principles of Geology," not only upset current theories regarding
the past history of our globe, but also revolutionised the very
formulæ on which these theories were founded. The influence
of this drastic clearance of antiquated machinery in geology
soon extended to the collateral sciences, and one of the first to
benefit from the improved methods was archæology. The first
great application of scientific methods to prehistoric researches
was made in the north of Europe. The Scandinavian savants,
in attempting to pry into the early history of their people,
found so little reliable information in their sagas and other
mythological fables, that they cast them altogether aside as
useless or misleading. Struck with the elegance and beauty
of the stone weapons and implements so profusely scattered
over the land, they seized the idea, occasionally previously
mooted by writers in other countries, but hitherto never
seriously considered, that there was a time when people were
entirely ignorant of the use of metals, and, in the prosecution
of their social industries, had to depend exclusively on
such tools as could be manufactured out of stone, horn, wood,
etc. To this idea they soon afterwards linked another,
which experience has also shown to be founded on accurate
observation, viz. that their earliest metal objects were made
from a nearly uniform compound of copper and tin, known as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
bronze. Iron, it was maintained, was not known in the country
for several centuries afterwards; but, on the other hand, when
it became known, it gradually superseded bronze in the manufacture
of all cutting implements and weapons, on account of
its superior qualities for such purposes.</p>

<p>These simple observations in the hands of the Scandinavian
scientists supplied the essential elements of a new system of
classification, which has since become so familiar all over the
world as the three ages of Stone, Bronze and Iron. Its adoption
by Dr. Thomsen, in 1830, as the basis of arranging the prehistoric
materials in the Museum of Northern Antiquities at
Copenhagen, and, a few years later, in the Museums of Lund
and Stockholm, marks the commencement of a new era in the
history of prehistoric archæology. Other nations were not slow
in following in the footsteps of the northern savants, and to
such an extent was this new departure carried that for a time
at least, all antiquarian objects were classified as belonging to
one or other of the so-called ages, on the mere knowledge of
their composition. So fascinating was the spell of this new
doctrine, that it was some time before even experienced archæologists
could see the fallacy of adhering rigidly to such a
method of arranging objects; as if, the instant a bronze or an
iron implement became known, the manufacture of its analogues
in the inferior materials there and then ceased for ever. While,
therefore, conceding that the chronological sequence of the
three ages, as determined in Scandinavia, is generally correct,
and holds good also for European countries, I consider it radically
wrong to suppose that the respective epochs indicated by these
successive stages of civilisation, especially in districts widely
separated, are identical in point of time. Many local circumstances
in a country, such as the poverty of the people, their
isolation and distance from commercial highways, etc., have often
so contributed to the persistency of customs and usages, elsewhere
become obsolete and entirely superseded, that a chronological
comparison of its progress in civilisation, as defined by
the three ages, becomes perplexing, if not misleading, when
applied to other countries. The question resolves itself, therefore,
into this: that each well-defined archæological or geographical
area must ascertain the chronological sequence and
duration of these ages for itself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>But whatever may be the value of this system when applied to
the elucidation of early European civilisation, one thing is certain&mdash;that
it was the means of evoking throughout the entire world an
enormous amount of interest in archæological pursuits. Henceforth
primeval antiquities of every description, the merest "waifs and
strays" of humanity, things which previously were utterly ignored,
were now eagerly collected, described, and catalogued; and in
every centre of intelligence societies and journals were founded with
the express object of following up the new found trail of prehistoric
man. Since then the problem of man's place in nature has come
largely to the front, and now appeals for its solution to all departments
of science, and to all legitimate processes of reasoning.
Among those who devoted their energies to the study and elucidation
of the archæological phase of this problem was the learned
Ferdinand Keller, President of the Antiquarian Association at
Zürich, to whom the world is indebted for one of the most
remarkable archæological discoveries of this century&mdash;a discovery
which in its consequential results is unique for the variety and
wealth of materials with which it has illustrated that singular
but long unknown and forgotten phase of prehistoric civilisation
in Europe, which found its outcome in the habit of constructing
dwellings in lakes, marshes, etc. This discovery of Dr. Keller
was not of the nature of a lucky find, but was the result of a
purely mental process&mdash;a spark of superior intelligence&mdash;fostered,
I have no doubt, by his knowledge of these very Scandinavian
doctrines to which I have just referred.</p>

<p>In countries whose lakes and rivers are fed from snow-clad
mountains and glaciers, it is observed that their waters find their
greatest diminution in winter, when a portion of their supply is
temporarily suspended in the form of ice. This phenomenon
became unusually intensified in Switzerland during the winter
of 1853-4, so much so, that the level of its lakes had sunk lower
than had ever before been known. Some of the inhabitants of
the village of Ober-Meilen, on the east shore of Lake Zürich, took
advantage of this circumstance to extend their vineyards, by
recovering portions of the exposed shore, which they enclosed
with stone walls, and filled in the space with mud, so as to bring
its surface above the ordinary level of the lake. In the course
of these operations the workmen came upon the heads of wooden
piles around which were portions of stags' horns, stone hatchets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and other implements (<b><a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a></b>), which excited some
curiosity among them. The event, however, was not singular in the district,
as objects of a similar character were on several occasions
encountered along the shore of the lake; and even in this same
spot, in 1829, when the little harbour of the village was being
deepened, bits of rotten piles, as well as implements of stone
and horn, were turned up among the dredged stuff. They were
not, however, deemed of sufficient value to be rescued from the
mud, so that, along with it, they were carried away and re-deposited
in deep water. Also at Männedorf, a village a few
leagues farther up the lake, during the winter of 1843-4, while
its harbour was being enlarged, similar discoveries were made.
A few of the relics were on this occasion collected and sent to
the Museum at Zürich, where they are still to be seen. Indeed,
these, and other recorded instances of antiquarian remains being
fished up or dredged from the Swiss lakes, are by no means
exceptional events; but, however suggestive they may now appear,
they all failed to excite in the minds of their beholders that
great deduction which will for ever associate the name of Keller
with the lake-dwellings of Europe. On this occasion the schoolmaster
of the village of Ober-Meilen, Mr. Æppli, whose house
was close by, considered the find of sufficient importance to be
brought under the notice of the Antiquarian Association at
Zürich, which he accordingly did in the month of January, 1854.
Thus it was that Dr. Keller appeared on the scene. From the investigations
which subsequently ensued the following general facts were ascertained.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Composition of Lake-bed.</i>&mdash;First, or uppermost,
there was a stratum of yellowish mud, from 1 to 2 feet thick, mixed with
rounded pebbles, and in all respects similar to what was being
deposited in the shallow indentations of the lake in the vicinity.
Beneath this was a deposit of blackish mud, mixed with decayed
organic matter, and varying in thickness from 2 to 2&frac12; feet, in
which the tops of the piles appeared and all the relics were
found. The third stratum was in composition somewhat similar
to the first, and, like it, with the exception of the deeply
penetrating piles, was devoid of antiquarian remains.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Disposition of the Piles, etc.</i>&mdash;The exact dimensions
of the area occupied by the piles were not determined, but it appeared
to be considerable, and to stretch along the shore within a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
fathoms of the ordinary water-mark. The piles were made of
different kinds of wood&mdash;oak, beech, birch, and fir being the
most prevalent&mdash;and they varied in thickness from 4 to 6 inches.
Sometimes entire stems were used, but more frequently they were
split into halves or quarters. They were about 1&frac12; foot apart, and
had a kind of systematic arrangement in rows parallel to the
beach. Some piles were pulled up, and their tips were found to
have been pointed by blunt tools, the cuts of which were, in the
estimation of experienced carpenters who had examined them,
precisely similar to those which would be made by those very
stone implements collected around them.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Relics.</i>&mdash;The relics were of a mixed character, and
included the following:&mdash;Stone celts and chisels, some of them being
still fixed in their horn handles and fastenings (<b><a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a></b>,
Nos. 3, 4, 11, and 15); perforated hammer-axes (Nos. 8, 13, and 17); mealing-stones
and polishers (No. 12); various implements made of flint,
as scrapers, flakes (No. 1), saws (No. 2), and some rude arrow-points
(only one being neatly finished, No. 16); various objects
of horn and bone (Nos. 6 and 7); also some wooden clubs,
fragments of pottery, spindle-whorls (No. 14), shells of hazel-nuts,
etc. Among the relics then collected were a bead of amber
(No. 9) and a bronze armilla (No. 10).</p>

<p>After careful consideration of the facts thus brought to light,
Dr. Keller came to the conclusion that the piles had formerly
supported a wooden platform, that on this platform huts had been
erected, and that, after these had been inhabited for a long
period, the whole structure had been destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>A knowledge of these discoveries at Ober-Meilen, and of Dr.
Keller's opinion in regard to them, soon spread among the surrounding
inhabitants, the immediate result of which was a sudden
crop of lacustrine explorers, who carried on a vigorous search
for similar remains in this and the adjacent lakes. For their
guidance were requisitioned all sorts of traditions, stories of
submerged cities, of which many abounded, recollections of the
occasional finding of implements and weapons of unusual types,
etc.; but of greatest service was the local knowledge of fishermen,
who, from practical experiences of disasters to their nets and
fishing gear, could at once point out numberless localities where
large fields of submerged piling were to be found. In the spring
of the same year the celebrated station known as the Steinberg,
at Nidau, in Lake Bienne, was discovered, as well as numerous
other stations in the lakes of Bienne, Neuchâtel, and Geneva; so
that before an illustrated account of the Ober-Meilen discovery
could appear in the Transactions of the Antiquarian Society of
Zürich Dr. Keller had important materials of a similar character
from other localities to record. This report, entitled "Die Keltischen
Pfahlbauten in den Schweizerseen," appeared towards the close of
the year 1854, and at once attracted the attention of archæologists
in all countries. Since then lacustrine investigations in search of
lake-dwellings have been incessantly carried on, not only in
Switzerland, but in many other countries in Europe, with the
result that each year has seen an increase in their number, as
well as a corresponding enhancement of the archæological value
of the materials so discovered.

Prominent among the early investigators whose names have
a claim to be associated with this great discovery which has so
popularised the name of the Zürich antiquary were Colonel
Schwab, of Bienne, whose splendid collection of lake-dwelling
antiquities now adorns his native town; Professor Desor, author
of the admirable little treatise "Les Palafittes, ou Constructions
lacustres du lac de Neuchâtel," and other works; and Professor
Troyon of Lausanne, whose work, "Habitations lacustres des temps
anciens et modernes," is so well known. But foremost among
them all stood Keller himself, who from time to time, according
to the demands of fresh discoveries, issued systematic reports of
the Pfahlbauten, of which no fewer than six had appeared previous
to the year 1866. In that year was published the English
edition of Keller's reports, arranged and translated by Mr. Lee.
It is needless to pursue here any further in historical order the
various means, whether as publications or investigations, by
which Keller's discovery was being pursued, as they come to be
dealt with elsewhere. Suffice it to say that within a few years
of its publicity, the existence of lacustrine villages all over
Central Europe in prehistoric times was fully established.</p>

<p class="space-below2">From these remarks you will have some idea of
the work before us in these lectures. It contemplates a critical and
summary review of the principal results of the investigations of
the lake-dwellings of Europe during the last half-century. This
embraces a large geographical area, extending, roughly, from
Ireland to Bulgaria, and from Venice on the Adriatic to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
shores of the Baltic. Of the very numerous researches to which
I shall have to refer, some were conducted by private individuals,
others by public or scientific bodies, but all presumably
more or less qualified to give a correct report of the facts. The
records of successive discoveries have been generally published
in the proceedings of local societies, but sometimes in separate
monographs of extremely limited circulation. As to the
antiquities, some have found their way to dealers, and
have disappeared to foreign lands. A large proportion, however,
have been carefully preserved in the respective districts or
countries in which they were found, and are now located in
public museums or private collections, where, as a rule, they
are intelligently arranged and duly labelled. In conducting you,
as it were, over this wide area, amidst such diversified materials,
I shall be guided, to a certain extent, by geographical convenience,
even at the expense of historical sequence; and in
discussing typical finds I shall, as far as this may be practicable,
make use of diagrammatic and pictorial illustrations, believing that
even a poor illustration often conveys more information than the
most accurate description.</p>

<h3>LAKE ZÜRICH.</h3>

<p>Further discoveries in Lake Zürich were not so speedily
effected as in some of the other Swiss lakes, and for a few years
the interest in this subject was transferred to more distant localities.
In the following year, 1855, Colonel Schwab visited Zürich and
made further researches at Männedorf and Ober-Meilen. From the
latter he succeeded in securing a considerable number of objects,
especially stone hatchets, some of which were made of nephrite,
and a bronze celt of the flat type (<b><a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a></b>, No. 5).</p>

<p>In 1858, in the course of some dredging operations for the purpose
of deepening the mouth of the Limmat, fragments of pottery,
bits of piles, and some peculiar beams having one or two square-cut
holes (<b><a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a></b>, Nos. 13 and 14) were dredged
up. Dr. Keller recognised here the site of a Pfahlbau which extended both
under the little island called Bauschanze and outwards towards
the lake. (B. 22 and 336.)</p>

<p>Two other localities near the outlet known as the "Kleiner
Hafner" and "Grosser Hafner" were also proved to have been
stations. The former was opposite the north end of the Tonhalle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and about 150 yards distant from the original shore. It occupied a
circular area of about 1&frac12; acre in extent and, when the water was low,
its surface was only some 3 feet submerged. The Grosser Hafner
was farther off in the lake, and its area was considerably larger
than that of the Kleiner Hafner. On a clear day in both these
localities stones and the tops of piles could be seen. Another
locality known to Dr. Keller at this early period was about two
miles from Zürich, on the west shore of the lake and just
opposite the steamboat pier at Wollishofen. Here the lake-bed
consisted of a deposit of fine mud, and owing to the constant
commotion made by the steamers in passing to and fro the
<i>débris</i> of the lake-dwelling had been greatly covered up. (B. 336.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Map_1" id="Map_1"></a>
  <img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="481" />
</div>

<p class="space-above1">As the Kleiner Hafner lay directly along the course followed
by the steamers, and greatly obstructed their passage, the authorities,
in 1867, resolved to have the obstruction removed altogether.
For this purpose a dredging machine was used, by means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
which a segment several feet thick was removed from its surface.
During this operation the same kind of perforated beams which
had already attracted attention at the Bauschanze were turned
up among the stuff, together with numerous objects of flint, stone,
bone, etc., similar to those at Ober-Meilen (<b><a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a></b>, Nos. 9 to 17).
In addition to these, however, there were bronze axes of the
winged type, some spoon-shaped crucibles, large clay rings and
fragments of pottery of an unusually fine kind (<b><a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a></b>, Nos. 1 to 8).
But, what was considered still more strange, there were among
these relics some iron weapons and Roman tiles.</p>

<p>Hitherto there was little or nothing done to the Grosser
Hafner, and the "Haumessergrund" at Wollishofen, and so the
surmises of Dr. Keller regarding them might have died with
him, had it not been for the extraordinary exertions of the people
of Zürich to have their beautiful environments made still more
attractive by art. These extensive alterations, begun some six
years ago, and scarcely yet completed, have so entirely changed
the aspect of the shore in the immediate neighbourhood of the
outlet, that visitors whose recollection of the town dates farther
back than these transformations, will hardly recognise the locality.
A splendid bridge now spans the opening of the Limmat, and on
both sides of it are elegant promenades, gardens, and ornamental
quays, which occupy what was formerly part of the lake. The
filling up of such a great area of lake-bottom involved the use
of dredgers, which, with revolving buckets, raised stuff from the
most convenient shallows along the shore, and having dropped
it into boats, it was then transported to its final destination.
Among the localities selected for these operations were the
Grosser Hafner and the outskirts of the Bauschanze. The rich
loamy deposits of the Haumessergrund at Wollishofen were also
found suitable for mixing with the gravel and for forming a
good soil for the floral and horticultural gardens which now form
such a conspicuous ornament to the fashionable walks along the
northern shore of the lake.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
The Grosser Hafner<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> supplied a wonderful medley of antiquarian
objects, apparently of all ages&mdash;stone hatchets (one of
which was 10 inches long), horn handles, bone implements, etc.
Among bronze objects were: hatchets of the winged type, chisels,
sickles, knives some ornamented with half-circles, points, and
lines (<b><a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a></b>, Nos. 30 and 35); pins with large
heads, oval or round, and sometimes perforated and variously ornamented
(Nos. 24, 25, and 26); arm-rings, both closed and open, and ornamented
with engraved lines, dots, etc. (Nos. 18 and 28); a few
spirals (No. 34), small rings and pendants (Nos. 19 and 27);
two solid rings attached by a band (No. 29); a group of four
rings&mdash;one being larger, on which the other three were hung
(No. 20); a pin-like object, 15&frac12; inches long, with a handle like
that of a sword (No. 32); lance-heads, some of which were
ornamented; a few small beads of amber. Among the fragments
of pottery were two vessels complete with round bases (No. 31),
and part of a moon-shaped crescent, rudely ornamented with
depressions like finger-marks.</p>

<p>Here, again, as in the Kleiner Hafner, objects apparently of a
later date were found, among which were Roman tiles, pottery of
the kind known as <i>terra sigillata</i>, and an iron spear-head; also
upwards of 16 coins of the time of Augustus, Tiberias and Vespasian.</p>

<p>On the other hand, at the Bauschanze, while objects of the
stone age were very numerous, there were scarcely any of bronze.
Most of the objects collected on this station were dispersed; but
among the few that have come to the knowledge of antiquaries
are some remarkable implements of horn, like picks, said to be
field-hoes (Nos. 21 and 22). One of these is 14&frac12; inches long,
pointed at one end and chisel-shaped at the other. Another
(10&frac12; inches long) is also pointed at one end, but forked at the
other. Both are perforated with an oval hole for the insertion
of a wooden handle.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wollishofen.</span>&mdash;The greatest of all the finds in Lake Zürich
was that at Wollishofen. (B. 448, 449a, and 462.) Here, again,
the dredging machines brought up a large quantity of wood,
among which were some of those peculiar oak beams with square-cut
holes, already noticed (<b><a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a></b>, Nos. 13 and 14).
The wood was of various kinds, and so abundant that the poorer people
were in the habit of collecting it for firewood. Although the
antiquities of the stone age were numerous, the great feature of
this station is that it belonged to, or at least existed during,
the most flourishing period of the bronze age. Notwithstanding
pilfering, and the difficulty of detecting the smaller objects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the collection, as now deposited in the Museum at Zürich, must be
considered one of the most important in the whole series of
lake-dwelling researches. Among the more remarkable objects
were the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Weapons.</i>&mdash;Four bronze swords, one only of which is complete
(<a href="#Fig_3"><b>Fig. 3</b></a>, No. 1); its entire length is 28&frac12;
inches, including the handle, which is also of bronze (barely 4 inches long),
and to which the blade is attached by two rivets; another (No. 2),
which is defective both in the blade and handle, is of a different
type, especially in the formation of the handle, which was
intended to have bone or wooden plates fastened with rivets to
the remaining bronze portion; it is ornamented with a combination
of circles or semicircles, in incised lines or dots. Three
daggers, two of which have rivet-holes, and the third has
what appears to be the remains of a tang. Eleven arrow-heads
of bronze, and several of flint and bone. Of the former, two
only have sockets (Nos. 4 and 14), the others being imitations
of the ordinary flint forms (Nos. 3 and 5). Lance-heads were in
much larger numbers than either the swords or daggers; they
are mostly socketed, with side rivet-holes for fixing the handle;
they vary in length from 3&frac12; to 8 inches, and are sometimes
ornamented, as shown in No. 7, and only two had tangs. Portions
of wood are supposed to be fragments of bows.</p>

<p><i>Industrial Implements and Ornaments.</i>&mdash;The stone hatchets
are exceedingly well-made, and appear to have been partly sawn
from water-worn boulders of serpentine and hornstone. None
were of <i>nephrite</i> or <i>jadeite</i>; a few of horn have been noted
(<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 15). The bronze hatchets
(<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, Nos. 16, 20, and 25)
were numerous, the greatest number having four wings and sometimes
a loop at the side; the direction of the cutting edge is generally
at right angles to that of the wings, but in a few instances
parallel to it (as in No. 16); at the top of the hatchet there is
a hole or small recess. Of the flat kind there were a few, one
of which is here figured (No. 25). Two small ones are of copper
(<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 17). The knives are mostly ornamented
with running patterns or circles or semicircles in dots or lines, and the
blades are all more or less curved (<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, Nos. 11 to 15);
the handles were sometimes solid and of a piece with the blade, but
more frequently they were of horn or wood, and attached by
tangs or rivets. It is rather remarkable that amongst the large
number of knives collected at Wollishofen there is not one of the
socketed kind, which, as we shall afterwards see, are so frequently
met with in Lake Bourget and some stations in western Switzerland.
Some sickles of the usual type, fish-hooks, and a few of the
socketed razor knives. Of bronze hammers there are six, all of
which are socketed and either round or rectangular in shape
(<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, Nos. 8 and 18). The round one, No. 8,
is ornamented with a series of circular grooves, and has a socket 1&frac34;
inches deep; it weighs 490 grs.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
There is a considerable number of chisels and gouges (<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>,
Nos. 1 to 7), small tubes, broad-headed nails and studs. One
bronze punch is bifurcated (<i>Antiqua</i>, 1886, Pl. v. Fig. 8).
An elegant vase of solid bronze (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 22), and
fragments of large situlæ, made of thin bronze plates riveted
(<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, Nos. 17 and 22). One of the most remarkable
objects is that represented on <b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, No. 21, which
is supposed to be an anvil. Several long pins with sword-like handles, similar to
one found on the Grosser Hafner (<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, Nos. 9 and 10).
Bronze hair-pins were so numerous that they are to be counted
by hundreds in the Museum (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, Nos. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19
and 23 to 26). One bronze comb and one bronze fibula (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>,
Nos. 16 and 20). Bracelets are well represented, both closed
and open; they are either flat or in solid mass (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 13),
and generally ornamented; one (No. 15), open at the ends, is
made of two stout wires, one of which is spirally grooved, and
the other plain; these wires are united at the ends by a tin
pin, which passes through a loop formed by the recoil of the
ends of the wires. A large hollow ring (three inches internal,
and rather more than four inches external diameter) is highly
ornamented. (See <b><a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a></b>, No. 2.)
Finger-rings (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 28),
pendants (Nos. 29, 30, and 31), buttons (No. 21), studs (No. 27),
a so-called <i>portemonnaie</i>, for ring money (No. 33), portions of
girdles (<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, No. 19). There are also one ringlet
of gold and three beads, one of amber and two of glass. Amongst the nondescript
objects are several small wheels&mdash;three of pottery (<b><a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a></b>,
No. 6), five of bronze (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, Nos. 12 and 18), and two of tin (No.
32)&mdash;a leaden weight, which has a high loop of bronze (<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>,
No. 23). An object of the same kind (No. 24), with two loops, was
found at Onnens. Besides the two copper celts (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 17)
there were two small copper awls and several bits of this metal.

<p class="space-above1"><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;The pottery at Wollishofen shows
vessels made of two kinds of paste, one fine, and the other coarse containing a
mixture of rough sand. The vessels varied much in size, the
smallest being only about one inch in diameter, and the larger
ones, judging from the curve of the fragments, ranged from
sixteen to twenty-seven inches in diameter. They had no glaze,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
nor can it be said that the wheel was used in their manufacture,
although some are very symmetrically shaped. No quartz
or sand was mixed with the fine paste, of which the more ornamental
vessels were made (<b><a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a></b> Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7,
9, 11, and 12). Some had a conical-shaped base, and could only be made to sit
in soft material, such as sand, or by means of a ring, like those figured from
the Kleiner and Grosser Hafner. One small vessel was trilocular,
having its three chambers or bowls attached to one common base.
Some very flat vessels were found, which are supposed to have
been lids (<b><a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a></b>, No. 7). Spindle whorls of burnt
clay variously ornamented (<b><a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a></b>, Nos. 13 to 20),
and some other objects like modern thread pirns (Nos. 5 and 10) are in abundance.
Portions of six crescents are all differently ornamented. Some now in the
Museum have been restored, so as to show their original form and
ornamentation, and it is from one of these that the illustration
here given was taken (<b><a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a></b>, No. 8). Some dishes
took the forms of animals, as in No. 4, and were probably used as lamps.</p>

<p>Among other objects may be mentioned some bits of red
stone, supposed to have been used as paint; foundry materials,
as moulds and bronze dross; portion of a dug-out canoe;
various bits of sawn and cut horn; etc.</p>

<p><i>Human Remains.</i>&mdash;The only portion of a human skeleton
was a skull, which, according to Dr. Kollmann, is of the mesocephalic
type. (B. 420, p. 90.)</p>

<p><i>Organic Remains.</i>&mdash;Wheat, millet, hazel-nuts, and crab-apples,
were identified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Männedorf.</span>&mdash;I have already incidentally referred
to the discovery of the site of a lake-dwelling at Männedorf before 1854,
when such antiquities were not understood (<a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>). In 1866,
however, a portion of lake-bottom close to where these early
discoveries were made, measuring about eighty feet by thirty,
was deepened to facilitate the passage of steamers, when further
evidence as to the nature of this settlement was disclosed. The
piles were so closely set that there was hardly the breadth of a
pile between them. The objects collected were very similar to
those already described from Ober-Meilen, among which was
a spoon-like crucible like those from Robenhausen. (B. 126, p.
263.) The discovery of a second station near the mouth of the
Surenbach, between Männedorf and Uetikon, was noticed by Dr.
Keller in his second report. (B. 22, p. 121.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uetikon.</span>&mdash;Remains of another station are to
be found close by the landing stage at Uetikon, from which on several occasions
antiquities of the Stone Age were picked up. More decided
indications of the character of this settlement were, however,
revealed in 1886, in consequence of some dredging operations
that were carried on. On this occasion were found not only
piles, bones of various animals, as stag, ox, and pig, fragments
of pottery, stone hatchets, and flint implements&mdash;the usual relics
of the Stone Age&mdash;but also a few bronze rings and hair-pins.
(B. 462, p. 17.)</p>

<p>In the Zürich Museum may be seen a considerable number
of the relics from this station, among which are twenty-three
stone celts (one being still in its horn fastening), five flint saws
or scrapers, four pointers of horn, and a semi-globular spindle-whorl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erlenbach.</span>&mdash;Near Erlenbach were two settlements,
one at Winkel, a few minutes' walk above the village; and the other at
Wyden, about an equal distance below it. In 1886 the usual
indications of the Pfahlbau settlements, such as piles and various
industrial relics, were found in the course of some dredging
operations, but the objects were mostly dispersed.
(B. 462, and 420a, p. 73.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Letten.</span>&mdash;In 1877, while digging a canal in
connection with the Zürich waterworks, some remarkable antiquities of bronze
and iron were dug up, which Dr. Keller describes in the eighth
report of the lake-dwellings. They were found in a portion of
the cutting extending some eight hundred yards in length at a
place called Letten, on the right bank of the Limmat, nearly
opposite to where the Zihl joins it. The objects lay in a fine
mud deposited by the river, and underneath a bed of gravel of
the same origin. Dr. Keller came to the conclusion that the
"Lettenfunde" belonged to a settlement analogous to, and probably
contemporary with, the later Pfahlbauten, with the relics from
which they in many respects agree. A careful inspection of the
Letten relics&mdash;which include two swords, one or two spear-heads,
a variety of winged celts, a couple of sickles with raised buttons,
knives, a great number of hair-pins of diversified forms, an involved
ring-ornament, etc., all of bronze&mdash;shows that they are of
a more recent period than the lake-dwellings. Among the bronze
celts are forms (as for example that in <b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 35)
which have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
never been found in the true relic bed of a lake-dwelling; and
besides there are other objects, such as a fibula, and a piece of
iron partly fashioned, probably intended for a sword, which are
characteristic of the La Tène period. (See <b><a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a></b>,
No. 6.) While deepening the bed of the Limmat similar objects, as well as
those of preceding and succeeding ages (Roman), have been frequently
found. The Letten objects correspond more with the
pre-Roman antiquities found in the Nidau-Büren Canal and in
some of the later tumuli, and may therefore be said to link
together the products of two very different civilisations, viz. the
bronze age of the lake-dwellings, and the subsequent iron age,
so characteristic in La Tène.</p>

<h3>LAKE OF BIENNE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Investigations in the Jura Lakes, and Archæological
Result of the "Correction des Eaux du Jura."</span>&mdash;At a short
distance from the eastern shore of Lake Bienne, near where the
Zihl by several mouths found its former exit, there exists, or
rather formerly existed, a stony elevation, covering an area of
some three acres, which rose gradually from a depth of about
20 feet to within 7 or 8 of the surface. This curious cairn-like
structure, being in marked contrast with the surrounding lake
sediments which here consist chiefly of fine mud, was well-known
to the fishermen as the "Steinberg," <i>i.e.</i> stone hillock. Among
these stones were many projecting heads of piles which, to prevent
injury to their nets, the fishermen were in the habit from time
to time of pulling out. Moreover, at various times, on or near
this steinberg, Roman tiles and some fantastically shaped objects
covered with chalky concretions were picked up, which fostered
a vague opinion that it was the foundation of a Roman fortress
or lighthouse.</p>

<p>In 1854 Colonel Schwab and Mr. Müller of Nidau made a
careful investigation of the steinberg, the result of which was
to leave no doubt that it was the site of a lake-village which
had been erected over the piles, the stumps of which then only
were detected among the stones. These stones were of a pretty
uniform size, not too large to be transported readily by human
hands, and in material they were exactly similar to those scattered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
among the glacial <i>débris</i> on the neighbouring slopes. Interspersed
in this cairn were, not only the upright piles of round or split
stems, singly and in groups, but also transverse beams, which
had evidently not fallen at random but had been intentionally
placed and jammed between the uprights to keep them more
firmly in position. The strange-looking objects turned out to
be bronze implements encrusted with such a coating of lime
that their metallic nature had been effectually concealed. The
station quickly proved to be exceedingly rich in antiquities of
new and varied forms. Not only the usual objects of the Stone
Age, but even implements of iron and fragments of pottery of
unusual elegance were fished up.</p>

<p>This discovery was greatly talked of in the district, and led
to such a lively search for the sites of lacustrine abodes that
before the end of the year some half-dozen stations were
identified in the Lake of Bienne alone, not to mention a much
larger number in the adjacent lakes. Notwithstanding the difficulties
under which these lacustrine investigations were conducted,
as dredging or digging under several feet of water was both
laborious and expensive, the number of objects collected by the
Swiss antiquaries in those early years is astonishingly great, as
evidence of which I have only to point to the collections of Col.
Schwab and Professor Desor.</p>

<p>It is often the case that antiquarian remains owe their discovery
to the mere accident of agricultural operations, peat-cutting,
drainage, etc. Such operations are, however, usually confined
to small lakes and bogs. The idea of partially lowering the
surface of the extensive sheets of water in the Jura valley,
comprising the lakes of Bienne, Neuchâtel, and Morat, was too
chimerical to be ever entertained in the interests of archæology.
But what was inconceivable and utterly beyond hope from this
point of view, became, in the interests of agriculture, not only a
practical problem, but is now an accomplished fact. Between
the lakes of Bienne, Neuchâtel, and Morat, there stretches a vast
mossy district known as the "Gross Moos," through which the
combined surplus water of the two latter lakes finds its way to
the former. From the north end of Lake Bienne the surplus
water again emerges, and is conveyed by the Zihl or Lower Thielle
in a sluggish channel for some miles farther down the valley,
where, before the Correction des Eaux du Jura, it united with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Aar. As the surface of these lakes is nearly on the same level,
it is more than probable that in early prehistoric times their
waters formed one united sheet, which in the course of ages
became separated into three lakes by the interposition of the
sedimentary and peaty deposits now forming the Gross Moos. Their
connecting channels, the Broye and the Upper Thielle, owing to
the sluggishness of the flow, became gradually raised by the
constant deposition of mud, thus proportionately raising the level
of the confined waters, and consequently rendering the surrounding
lands more and more liable to submergence. Also, the river
Aar, though passing quite in the vicinity of the lake of Bienne,
went a long way beyond it before joining with the Zihl, and often
caused great havoc by flooding the richly-cultivated lands of the
lower grounds.</p>

<p>To remedy these defects the Swiss Government entered on
the gigantic project of rectifying and deepening the entire
waterway from the junction of the Lower Thielle with the Aar
to the mouth of the Broye in Lake Morat. The scheme also
included the cutting of a new channel for the Aar, by means
of which it would be entirely diverted from its old course,
and made to debouch into Lake Bienne by a straight and much
shorter route. (See Sketch Map, <a href="#Map_2">page 23</a>.)</p>

<p>The hydrographical result of these works (which were begun
in 1868, and only completed a few years ago) was to lower the
surface of these lakes to the extent of six or eight feet. In the
winter of 1871-2 the operations began to tell on Lake Bienne,
but it was some years later before the others became sensibly
affected. When, however, the works were completed, the permanent
effect on these lakes, especially on Lake Neuchâtel, was
very marked&mdash;harbours, jetties, and extensive tracts of shore-land
being left high and dry by the subsiding waters. This was the
harvest-time of archæology. Many of the lacustrine abodes
became dry land, and were visited by crowds of eager searchers;
even fishermen forsook their normal avocations, finding it more
profitable to fish for prehistoric relics. Government at last
interfered with this indiscriminate "howking," and passed a law
restricting the privilege of excavating to the authorities of the
respective Cantons on whose territories the stations happened
to be. Thus the "Correction des Eaux du Jura," as the undertaking
was called, greatly facilitated the investigations of the
Swiss lake-dwellings, and contributed enormously to the elucidation
of the culture and civilisation of their inhabitants.

In the following descriptive notes of the stations in Lake
Bienne I follow simply the order of their distribution along its
shore, making, as it were, a circular tour of the lake, beginning
at Nidau, and passing along its southern shore, then round to
the other side, until we come back to our starting-point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nidau-Steinberg.</span>&mdash;This station was so
thoroughly investigated by Colonel Schwab and his assistants that little
remained to be done after the lowering of the water. The objects
collected are both numerous and varied, and being among the
earlier of the kind brought to light from the lake-dwellings, they
have been fully illustrated by Dr. Keller. (B. 15 and 22.) Among
them were some heavy stone weights, some perforated, and some
with an iron hoop; discoidal stones, with a marginal groove; a
variety of corn crushers, polishers, and hammer-stones, etc.</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;Sickles and axes, both socketed and winged,
generally with a side loop, but without a notch at the top. Knives
were numerous, and some were ornamented with flowing lines and
semicircles; they were hafted by tangs or sockets, but in a few
instances the blade and handle were cast in one piece. Several
spear-heads, one of which is richly ornamented with a series of
rings and a serpentine pattern; a few arrow-points with barbs;
several socketed chisels of various sizes; numerous needles, hair-pins,
fish-hooks, curiously-shaped pendants, rings, and bifurcated
pincer-like objects; one hexagonal-shaped hammer with a
socket, and another having a small loop attached to the side
like that of a celt. Some remarkably fine bracelets, open at the
ends, and hollow, and having the outside ornamented with
concentric circles, lines, etc.; others are solid, or made of
spirally-grooved wire. A number of so-called razors, buttons,
studs, broad-headed nails, spirals, the central portion of a
horse-bit, etc.</p>

<p><i>Gold.</i>&mdash;A small spiral of gold wire, and a
square piece of thin plate neatly corrugated.</p>

<p><i>Iron.</i>&mdash;A few conical javelins with sockets.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;The potter's art seems to have been carried
to great perfection. The vessels were of all sizes, from two to
three feet in diameter down to the most tiny objects. They were
generally round at the base, and required ring supports, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
which many were found. Some shallow plates were ornamented
with squares, oblongs, and circles. Various forms of spindle-whorls,
some of which are made of fine paste, and blackened
with charcoal, like the finest pottery. Over twenty clay crescents,
represented by fragments, and one of stone. Some clay cylinders,
weights, and a few rude figures of a four-footed animal.</p>

<p><i>Bone, Wood, etc.</i>&mdash;A few bone implements, pointers, etc.;
the side piece of a bridle-bit of staghorn, perforated with three holes;
portion of a yoke, clubs, etc.; bits of clay with marks of wattle-work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Graseren.</span>&mdash;A small station concealed in rushes,
and containing large piles. The antiquities consist of a few iron objects, one
being a dagger with the handle ornamented with silver wire, and
a few mealing-stones and rubbers, etc. (B. 22.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sutz.</span>&mdash;This was a very large settlement,
the piles extending over an area of about 6 acres. It was connected with the
shore by a bridge or gangway, about 100 yards long and 13 wide. Within
its area several steinbergs were interspersed; and the relic-bed,
from 4 to 16 inches thick, was near the surface. The piles were
mostly of oak, and irregularly placed. The antiquities are classified
as belonging to both the Stone Age and the Bronze Age, among
which the following are the more interesting (B. 15 and 286):&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Hatchets of the usual form (a few of nephrite)
and others perforated; beads or spindle-whorls, one of quartz; flint
arrow-heads, flakes, and knives.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i>&mdash;Among the horn objects were fixers for axe-heads,
many with a <b>V</b>-shaped split at the end, probably for being
better fixed in the wooden handle; perforated portions of staghorns,
in the form of hammers and clubs, three of which, in
the Museum at Bern, are remarkable for their irregular forms.</p>

<p><i>Amber.</i>&mdash;Two or three well-made beads.</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;A sword (<b><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a></b>, No. 9),
a fibula, a winged celt with burnt portion of the wooden handle still remaining
between the flanges, a few hair-pins, and a hook shaped like a Roman key.</p>

<p><i>Iron.</i>&mdash;Two lance-heads like those from Nidau, and a curious
trident-like object. (B. 31, Pl. xv. 10.)</p>

<p><i>Wood.</i>&mdash;A bow of yew, quite perfect (length, 5 feet 3 inches),
portion of basket-work, and some wooden dishes with handles.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;The ceramic art is poorly represented here; only
fragments of a coarse quality, and ornamented with finger or
string marks, are recorded. (B. 462, Pl. ix. 4.) Two clay cylinders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
are in the Museum at Bern, like those from Wollishofen (<b><a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a></b>,
Nos. 5 and 10), together with some perforated clay weights.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of this station there are some ruins of
Roman buildings, a fact which is suggestive as an explanation of a
quern or millstone made after the Roman fashion, which is
reckoned as a relic from this lake-dwelling. From systematic
investigations carried on here in 1884, Dr. v. Fellenberg concluded
that the station belonged to the transition period, like
Vinelz. (B. 462, p. 34.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lattringen.</span>&mdash;Dr. Gross describes two stations
here, both of which, from the prevailing character of the antiquities, appear
to have belonged to the Stone Age, although previous to his
investigations some bronze objects were said to have been fished
up from one of them by Colonel Schwab.</p>

<p>The first, or lower station, covered a space of some 5 acres,
and its remains are situated opposite the little port of the
village of Lattringen. It was connected with the shore by four
bridges, the largest of which was 65 yards long and 14 feet wide.
The relics collected by Dr. Gross are of the Stone Age, and among
them are staghorn haftings and a fine harpoon with 11 barbs
and a perforation at its obtuse extremity. According to Fellenberg,
this station belonged to the middle Stone Age period, as it has
yielded no copper implements, nor perforated hammer-axes, but
on the other hand most excellent nephrite implements. (B. 462,
p. 35.) The collection of objects from this station in the Cantonal
Museum at Bern contains among other things:&mdash;Daggers; chisels,
harpoons, and pointers of bone and horn; some perforated horn
hammers and horn holders for stone axes (only two of which
have the end split); a number of flint arrow-points, all flat based.
A few stone beads and bits of rock crystal. One small dagger-blade
with four rivet-holes is of bronze or copper.</p>

<p>Previous to Dr. Gross's report, the following objects have been
recorded as coming from this station:&mdash;Mealing-stones, fragments
of coarse pottery, a bronze dagger, a shovel-shaped bronze axe,
and a spiral ring, also of bronze. (B. 15, p. 95.) The upper station
is 500 or 600 feet from the former, just opposite the erratic block
known as the <i>Sumpfstein</i>. It contained a small steinberg, and
yielded fine lance-heads of flint, a stone axe of serpentine sharpened
at both ends and perforated with an oval hole, and one or two
horn objects. (See <b><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a></b>, Nos. 7 and 11.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moeringen.</span>&mdash;Judging from the number and
variety of antiquities collected from Moeringen, it must be ranked as the
most important station in Lake Bienne. The settlement occupied
a sheltered bay called the "Moeringen Ecken," and covered a
rectangular area about 550 feet long and 350 wide. The relic-bed
was covered with eight or ten inches of sand and mud.
When discovered, and during the earlier years of its investigation,
piles were seen protruding more or less out of the mud,
and among them could be readily distinguished the ends of
several canoes. Investigations have been made here almost every
favourable season since its discovery by Mr. Müller in 1854, but
in the winter of 1872-3 Government took the matter into their
own hands, and conducted systematic explorations under the care
of Messrs. Fellenberg and Jenner. It then became apparent
that there were two stations in this bay&mdash;one belonging to the
Stone Age, and another to the Bronze Age&mdash;between which a
well-defined distinction could be made, especially in respect of
the piles. The former occupied a position nearer the shore, and
the stumps of its piles were hardly visible; while the latter was in
deeper water, and its piles, less decayed than the former, projected
1&frac12; to 2 feet above the lake sediment. Both had bridges extending
to the shore, as was indicated in each case by the remains of
a double row of piles. But while the bridge of the Stone Age
settlement was 5 to 8 feet wide, that of the Bronze Age was 10
to 12 feet wide, and moreover it was much longer, being over
200 yards in length. Dr. v. Fellenberg calculates, from counting
the piles in one or two selected places, that for the entire bronze
settlement somewhere about 10,000 piles must have been used.</p>

<p>The exploration of the settlement at Moeringen undertaken by
Government was continued in 1874, by which time the level of
the lake had fallen to such a degree that most of the bronze
station was laid dry, and many additional relics were added to
the already large collections from this station. Among the more
interesting may be mentioned some burnt boards and posts with
square holes, supposed to indicate the position and remains of
huts or workshops. (B. 271.)</p>

<p>The earlier investigators, Col. Schwab and Mr. Müller, collected
from this station a number of objects, now deposited in
the Schwab Museum, among which are the following:&mdash;An iron
sword of the La Tène type, and a curious iron fork. Of bronze,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
there are knives, hair-pins, and a variety of pendants. Some
beads of glass and amber. Novel specimens of earthenware;
charred apples, grains of wheat, and beans; ropes and cords made
of flax and bast; etc.</p>

<p>The smaller station, according to Fellenberg, belonged to the
middle Stone Age period. A number of stone beads, some of
white quartz, were found in a contracted space, which are supposed
to have formed a necklace. (B. 462, p. 36.)</p>

<p>The two best collections from Moeringen are in the Cantonal
Museum and in the Federal Government rooms (Gross collection),
both at Bern.</p>

<p>Of the very remarkable antiquities found here, Dr. Gross
(B. 286) gives a full account, classifying the objects under the
following heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Arms.</i>&mdash;Swords (<b><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a></b>,
Nos. 4, 5, and 6), daggers, lances, arrows.</p>

<p>2. <i>Instruments.</i>&mdash;Hatchets, sickles, polishing stones, discoidal
stones, anvils, spindle-whorls, and weaving weights.</p>

<p>3. <i>Objects of Dress.</i>&mdash;Girdles and belt-buckles, hair-pins, fibulæ,
bracelets, rings, earrings, beads of amber and glass, etc.</p>

<p>4. <i>Objects belonging to Horses' Harness.</i>&mdash;Bridle-bits of bronze,
iron, and horn; phaleræ. (See <b><a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a></b>, Nos. 3 to 7, and 13.)</p>

<p>5. Pottery, crescents, etc.</p>

<p>6. Sundry objects.</p>

<p>As specimens of the bronze relics from this station, I give the
illustrations on <b><a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a></b>, selected from the beautiful
coloured plates of Desor and Favre. (B. 252.) The purpose of these objects is
sufficiently manifest without entering on a detailed description.</p>

<p>I will only remark that the unique dagger, the handle of which
is here only represented (No. 5), consists of a stout bronze rod
twenty-one inches long, pointed at one end, and becoming quadrangular
at the other, where it enters a socket in the handle.
The free end of the handle terminates in a fixed ring, on which
are three movable rings; and on its body there is a secondary
handle, with a curious curved appendage in front of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerlafingen</span>
(<span class="smcap">Gerofin</span>).&mdash;There were two settlements
here also&mdash;one of the Stone Age, covering little more than half an
acre; and the other of the Bronze Age, of much larger
dimensions and farther from the shore than the former. The
stations had separate bridges, the remains of which again
suggested that these approaches were larger during the Bronze
Age. The Stone Age station was covered with mud, and the
relics from it consisted of stone celts (one perforated), flint
flakes, and some fragments of coarse pottery.

The second station (Unter Station oder Oefeliplätze) contains
a steinberg which communicated with an adjacent tongue of
land by a bridge. There was no well-defined relic-bed, but the
relics picked up are of great value, among which are the
following<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>:&mdash;A
number of nephrite and jadeite hatchets, a
nephrite knife in its horn handle, flint knives, a wooden spoon,
a miniature canoe, four copper chisels (B. 286, Pl. ix. 34
and 35), two flat hatchets of bronze, showing rudimentary
wings, a double-stemmed hair-pin (B. 286, Pl. x. 2), two
daggers of bronze, one triangularly shaped (B. 286, Pl. iii.
17), a massive bracelet of bronze, some staghorn hammers,
a scoop, some large clay weights, etc. In the Bern Museum
are thirteen beads of copper, graduated so as to form a necklet;
some arrow-heads of rock crystal; an ammonite and another
shell (pectunculus), both perforated; also some perforated small
bones, teeth, and beads of horn. (B. 462, p. 64, and Pl. xiv.)
Dr. Gross estimates the number of jade implements from Oefeli
at thirty or forty, the largest being four inches long, and the
smallest one inch (both of nephrite).</p>

<p>Piles were found in various spots in this locality; and associated
with one group were Roman remains, such as fragments
of tiles, pottery, coins, and bits of glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hagneck.</span>&mdash;In this locality, near where
the Aar now debouches into the lake, and about one hundred yards from the
shore, were formerly to be seen some piles, but the relic-bed
seemed to have been washed away. Desor found some stone
hatchets and a few other relics. The station was connected with
the shore by a bridge sixty-five yards long and thirteen feet wide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ile de St. Pierre.</span>&mdash;On the south side of
this island there are remains of an extensive settlement, the piles of which
run parallel to the bank. A large canoe was observed here, lying
in the mud, apparently having been swamped with a load of
stones, with which it still was filled. It was 50 feet long, and
3&frac12; to 4 feet wide. Near the piles a bronze pin with an oval
head, and ornamented with wavy lines, was picked up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Another station was on the north-east side of the island, which
is now dry, and on which a large number of bronze objects was
collected; but there was no regular relic-bed, and as the objects
were gathered on the surface, Dr. v. Fellenberg thinks it has been
washed away. (B. 462, p.31.) Among the relics are a bronze
knife, a compound pendant curiously arranged (B. 286, Pl. viii. 3),
a pair of pincers, portion of a chain consisting of rings and
bands, and several fragments of swords, celts, and sickles; also
an iron sword with the handle of bronze.</p>

<p>On the south side of the Ile des Lapins there are some
piles, which point to this being the site of a station, but on
the island itself antiquities of various ages have been collected,
such as Roman roofing tiles and coins, a pretty gold ornament,
and many objects of Gallo-Roman manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Locras</span> (<span class="smcap">Lüscherz</span>).&mdash;Owing
to the depth of water over the ruins of the settlement opposite this village,
the station, although known to Colonel Schwab, did not assume any importance till
the winter of 1871-2, when the waters commenced to fall, and
the Bernese Government undertook a series of investigations.
The extent of the settlement was estimated by Dr. Gross at
about four acres, and it had been connected with the shore by
a short bridge. The relic-bed, four to twenty inches thick, lay
under a considerable accumulation of sand and gravel, and
consisted of a blackish stratum of organic <i>débris</i>, which appears
to have been peculiarly favourable for the preservation of the
usually perishable objects of human industry. It is therefore
singularly rich in such remains, and has furnished balls of
linen thread, fragments of cloth made of flax, heaps of grain,
and various remains of cultivated plants.</p>

<p>In prosecuting the exploration of the station it was found
that the relic-bed became more deeply buried the farther it
was pursued outwards; so that from 2&frac12; feet, its depth on the
shore side, it gradually increased to 7&frac12; on the opposite side.
The piles were of oak, beech, silver fir, pine, poplar, and birch,
mostly in the form of round stems. All these different kinds
of wood appear to have been used in nearly the same proportion
all over the settlement except at the north-west corner, at a
place called the Steinberg, where the piles were entirely of split
oak stems. Another peculiarity was that the piles were more
superficial, and hence it was suggested that this corner was of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
later date. Like most of the other lake-dwelling settlements, the
woodwork showed marks of burning. The theory of some sudden
catastrophe, such as a general conflagration, was strengthened by
the number of human remains&mdash;no less than three skulls and some
bones of the trunk and extremities&mdash;that were found at a depth
of 3 feet.</p>

<p>Among the antiquities recorded by Dr. Gross (B. 286) the
following may be mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Several hundreds of polished celts, about 30 of
which were jadeite or nephrite; flint implements of black and yellow
flint, and beautifully formed, such as lance-heads, arrow-points,
saws, and flakes; some round pebbles, about the size of a pigeon's
egg, encircled with birch-bark, and arranged in a row, like peas
in a pod; spindle-whorls, corn-crushers, etc.</p>

<p><i>Horn and Bone.</i>&mdash;A large number of haftings, probably
from 600 to 800, many still retaining a stone celt or chisel; about
40 axe-hammer heads, perforated with a square or round hole;
two little combs with three teeth; chisels, needles, awls, bodkins,
arrow-points; a carding implement made of a number of small
ribs pointed at one end and tied together, etc.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;A large number of entire vessels and fragments
show that two qualities of paste were used, a coarse and a fine
kind. Among them are bowls, plates, jugs&mdash;some having the
ordinary handle and others perforated knobs; clay weights, round,
cylindrical, or conical.</p>

<p><i>Sundry Objects.</i>&mdash;Portion of a spindle with the thread wound
round it (carbonised), various wooden handles, dishes, and implements;
fragments of cloth, matting, burnt straw, etc. One
small flat dagger of copper is in the Bern Museum.</p>

<p>The following extract from the Government Report by Mr.
Jenner, Dr. v. Fellenberg's deputy (B. 119, 2nd ed., p. 203), gives a
good idea of the comparative numbers of these relics:&mdash;"The
results of my excavations, which occupied 27 days, and extended
over an area of 20,000 square feet, at a medium depth of 3&frac12; feet,
the relic-bed being from 2 inches to 1&frac12; foot thick, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

Contiguous to the station just described, on its north-east
side, and separated from it by a dozen paces or so, there came subsequently
to light another station, described by Dr. Gross as
"Une nouvelle palafitte de l'époque de la pierre à Locras." (B. 336
and 347.) Its area was only about a fourth of the former, and
the relic-bed, being quite near the surface, was easily worked.
Two human skulls were found here, one of which appears to
have been used as a drinking-cup. From the character of the
relics generally, the settlement seems to have flourished during
the transition period. There were perforated axe-hammer heads,
with grooves and raised ridges, like Scandinavian forms, and a
few metal objects. The latter consist of three articles of copper&mdash;a
remarkable double celt of large size (<b><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a></b>,
No. 10), a dagger, and an awl&mdash;and three articles of bronze, viz. a sword,
a dagger-blade, and a hair-pin. The other objects are of the
usual Stone Age type, among which may be noted as of rather
uncommon occurrence an arrow-point of nephrite (B. 347, Pl. ii. 9),
and a knife of the same material with one cutting edge
(<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 28).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vinelz</span> (<span class="smcap">Fenil</span>).&mdash;This
station, which is now entirely on dry land, was accidentally discovered in 1881 by labourers while
digging a ditch to carry off water accumulating on the fields.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
At a depth of two or three feet of sand and gravel they came
upon a blackish bed of mud-earth, in which were detected a
number of piles, the heads of which projected upwards into the
sand and gravel for about a foot. Dr. Gross, who was informed
of the circumstance, soon visited the spot, and at once recognised
the site of a lake-dwelling. It appears that the locality
is much exposed to the north winds, and that the settlement
had thus become completely covered over with sand and gravel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
thrown up on the shore, as was the case with the station of
Wangen in the Untersee. During the spring and summer of 1882
the new Pfahlbau was investigated by several experts, including
Drs. Gross and v. Fellenberg. The station is remarkable for the
number of copper objects which it has yielded to the systematic
explorations ordered by Fellenberg, and carefully conducted by
Ed. Matthys, of Ligerz. From the results thus obtained, the
station at Vinelz is the most typical yet discovered of the final
Stone Age period (<i>Uebergangszeit</i>). (B. 462, p. 33.) The following
are some of the antiquities collected, most of which are in
the Cantonal Museum of Bern and the Gross collection.</p>

<p>Among nearly 100 copper objects (including 46 beads,
<b><a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a></b>, No. 31) are several daggers (Nos. 26 and 28),
flat axes (No. 27), chisels (No. 24), rude knives, awls (Nos. 17 and
25), pendants (No. 23), tubes and spirals (Nos. 22 and 30).
No bronze or iron object has yet been found on this station.
Bone and horn handles, polished daggers, large button-like
objects (Nos. 20 and 21), perforated clubs, ornamental pins
(Nos. 15, 16, and 18), etc., are numerous. Perforated stone axes
and the ordinary polished celts are common (about 40 of
the former and 100 of the latter being in the Bern Museum).
Flint daggers, sometimes worked at both ends (No. 12), are
also very fine; two were found in their wooden handles (No. 11).
For more firmly fixing them a fine band of reed or withe
was neatly rolled round the handle. A variety of flint arrow-heads,
scrapers, etc. (Nos. 1 to 9), clay weights of different
forms, implements of pointed ribs, basket-work, etc. For bits of
well-woven cloth, thread, and fishing-nets, this station vies with
Robenhausen. A portion of a spindle has some thread still round
it. There was an entire fishing-net (carbonised) associated with a
number of stone sinkers.</p>

<p>The pottery (Nos. 29, 32, and 33) was ornamented with dots
and string-marks. One vessel had a horn-shaped handle projecting
from the body of the vessel.</p>

<p>Wooden objects are also well represented in the form of
dishes, clubs, handles, and net-floats. One portion of wood had
some pointed flints stuck in it with resin, which had evidently
been used like a saw (<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 17),
finger-marks having been cut out in the wood, by means of which the
instrument could be more readily grasped.

<p class="space-above1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Saint Jean.</span>&mdash;A little less than a mile from the lake, in
the marshy plain, some bronze objects were found, which point to
this as the site of a station. Below Landerdon there are also
some piles, the tops of which are much decayed and deeply
buried in mud. Dr. Gross is reported to have found here a
sword of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schaffis</span> (<span class="smcap">Chavannes</span>).&mdash;This
settlement stretched as a narrow band on the left bank of the lake, and though known
for a considerable time it remained unexplored till the lowering
of the water facilitated its investigation. This was done by
Dr. v. Fellenberg, in 1873, on behalf of the Government. (B. 271.)</p>

<p>Three steinbergs were found on its site, two of which were
close together. In the vicinity of these steinbergs the piles
were placed in rows running outward into the lake. Elsewhere
they were irregularly but closely placed, seldom more than two
feet apart, and penetrated deeply into the old black lake-sediment.
Few timbers were met with, though twigs, basket-work, and charred
food, were common.</p>

<p>The total length of the station was 640 feet, and greatest
breadth 167 feet. The largest steinberg measured 217 by 65 feet.
Several bridges, from 30 to 60 feet in length, connected the piled
area with the shore. The station is now completely dry, and
overgrown with vegetation.</p>

<p>On the steinbergs the relic-bed was quite superficial, being
covered only with a thin layer of sand and gravel. The organic
remains, such as staghorn haftings and bone implements, were of
a blackish colour, and so much decomposed that few could be
preserved from crumbling into pieces. Stone celts were very
numerous, but unusually small, as, out of several hundred
specimens, only a few reached the length of 5 or 6 inches. The
majority were only 3 inches long, and although well polished
and sharpened along the cutting edge, they were of inferior
workmanship when compared with those of some other stations, such
as Locras. They were all manufactured of materials readily found
in the surrounding country, with the exception of three jade
implements (two jadeite and one nephrite). Large slabs for
grinding and polishing these tools were remarkably abundant.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the station is prominent for the beauty and
elegance of its flint implements, many of which were, when found,
still in their horn or wooden handles. Along with the horn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
haftings may be mentioned perforated hammers, chisels, barbed
harpoons, pins, awls, flax-heckles, amulets, perforated teeth, and
boars' tusks of great size. Among wooden objects the most remarkable
are a wooden door, still retaining portion of a polished
oval bolt of yew which traversed it horizontally (B. 336, p. 48),
and a portion of a ladder (B. 347). The fragments of pottery
indicated not only coarse material but rude workmanship. The
clay is badly burnt, and it is uniformly mixed with pieces of
quartz or small pebbles of the size of a pea. The vessels are
roughly cylindrical, and have thick bases, but no ornamentation,
not even the projecting knobs so characteristic of Locras. Some
large clay balls, perforated in the centre, are probably loom-weights,
and among the remains are bits of plaited and woven
flax, which prove that the art of weaving was well known to the
inhabitants. Dr. v. Fellenberg, from whose writings I have taken
the substance of this notice, considers the settlement one of the
earliest among the Swiss lake-dwellings and much inferior to
some of the other Stone Age settlements in Lake Bienne.</p>

<p>A cup made from the upper part of a human skull found
here has attracted much attention. (B. 119, 2nd ed., p. 221.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twann</span> (<span class="smcap">Douanne</span>).&mdash;It
must be remembered that the west side of the lake does not present the same
facilities for pile-dwellings as the opposite shore, owing to the steepness
of the immediate shore-land and the rapidity with which deep water
is met with. Moreover, the narrow strip of beach available for
the purpose has become greatly covered up with alluvial deposits,
as is proved from a discovery made at Twann. Here, at a depth
of 15 or 20 feet, some workmen, while making excavations in
connection with railway works near the quay, came upon a
blackish bed of mould containing piles, pottery, staghorn implements,
etc., which, on being inspected by Dr. Gross who happened
to be passing at the time, was at once recognised as the site of
a lacustrine station. Mr. Irlet, of Twann, has also discovered
another station at Wingreis, in the vicinity of which the canoe,
now so well preserved in the Museum at Neuveville, was found.
(<a href="#Page_481">See page 481</a>.) The objects from Wingreis consist
of stone hatchets, flints, and horn handles. (B. 462, p. 32.)</p>

<p>In 1886 another station, called "Bipschal," was announced by
Dr. v. Fellenberg as having been discovered by Ed. Matthys
between Ligerz and Twann. (B. 462, p. 35.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vingelz.</span>&mdash;Dr. v. Fellenberg states (B. 462, p. 32)
that in 1874, when the great canoe which for many years was known
to be lying in the mud near Vingelz was raised, a deeply-buried
relic-bed was brought to light.</p>

<p>Nearly 3,000 feet from the shore, and opposite the steinberg
of Nidau, there is what is supposed to have been a small station,
on which a few objects were found, among which is to be noted
a great stone weight with an iron ring round it. A group of
piles was observed to run from it in the direction of the Nidau
steinberg, and hence it is conjectured that a bridge formerly
connected the two. (B. 15 and 22.)</p>

<p>Between Vingelz and Bienne there is a small steinberg, on
which a few arrow-heads of iron are said to have been found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Port.</span>&mdash;During the excavations for the
"Correction des Eaux du Jura" some remarkable discoveries were made,
especially along the Lower Thielle, between Nidau and Meyenried. Immediately
below the little village of Port the remains of a palatitte of the
Stone Age were met with. The station appeared to have been
of considerable extent, as the piles were traced for several hundred
yards along the line of the canal. The relic-bed was 7 feet
below the surface, and amongst its <i>débris</i> were found various
implements of stone and horn. Among the stone celts was one
of nephrite, still in its horn fastening, the handle of which was
covered over with a bluish coating of amorphous vivianite.
(B. 446, p. 11.)</p>

<h3>LAKE OF NEUCHÂTEL.</h3>

<p>The Lake of Neuchâtel, like that of Bienne, was studded
with lake villages, particularly in the more sheltered localities.
From data collected by Col. Schwab a chart was constructed and
published in 1863, showing no less than 46 stations in the lake;
but many of them were of little archæological value beyond
giving indications of their existence. Since then some additional
sites have been added to this list, and from the activity with
which lacustrine researches have been conducted, especially after
the lowering of the water by the "Correction des Eaux," many
of the supposed less important sites have turned out extremely
rich in antiquities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pont de la Thielle.</span>&mdash;Leaving the Lake of Bienne,
and following the Upper Thielle, we come to the Pont de la Thielle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
(Zihlbrücke), which crosses the river at a short distance below
where it emerges from Lake Neuchâtel. A little above this bridge
and on both sides of the river, Col. Schwab discovered piles,
among which he collected some industrial remains at a depth of
5 feet, from which he concluded that there had been here an
ordinary pile-dwelling, in what was then probably a bay of the
lake. With the exception of one hair-pin of bronze, the objects
collected were of the Stone Age. (B. 32.) In 1870 v. Fellenberg
made some further investigations, which, while justifying the
conclusions previously arrived at, showed that the station had
larger dimensions than were formerly suspected, and that the relic-bed
was in some parts deeply buried. He enumerates the following
relics as the result of his labours:&mdash;7 large stone axes and
9 small or imperfect ones, of serpentine, diorite, etc.; 20 implements
of bone&mdash;pointers, daggers, chisels, etc.; a large number of
staghorn axe-hammer heads (perforated); flakes of flint and other
flint implements, and one beautifully-worked arrow-head; a knife
of polished nephrite. The pottery indicated a coarse paste mixed
with rough sand, and some of the vessels were ornamented with
knobs. (B. 196, p. 281.)</p>

<p>According to Mr. Dardel-Thorens,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
a Roman station succeeded the palafitte, as many objects of pure Roman origin
were found amongst the piles on the right bank. Among these he mentions
a lion head of bronze, portion of a girdle, a silver ring like those
from Pompeii, knives, chisels, axes, etc., and a tile with the legion
mark CLXXI; also a piece of worked horn with figures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Tène</span> (<span class="smcap">Stone Age Stations</span>).&mdash;Close
to the outlet, on its north side, is the celebrated station known as La Tène, which,
from the remarkable character and varied assortment of iron
implements found on it, has given a name to a well-defined
period of the Early Iron Age. Now that the lowering of the level
of the lake has left its site on dry ground, and its exploration has
become thus greatly facilitated, it would appear that La Tène was
more of a stronghold, commanding a bridge which crossed the
Thielle at its outlet, than a real pile-village. Its consideration will
therefore be deferred till we come to the description of the lake-dwellings
of the Iron Age.</p>

<p>Making a circuit of the lake westwards, we come at once on
a series of four stations, the ruins of which lie scattered on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
shore between La Tène and the promontory of Préfargier.
Their <i>débris</i> lay embedded in a thick bed of ancient mud, which
has since become undermined, and almost entirely washed away
by the waves, leaving the heavier antiquities amongst the rolled
pebbles. Some beautiful implements of nephrite and jadeite,
and occasionally copper objects, have been thus picked up, some
of which are still in the possession of Messrs. Vouga, Dardel-Thorens,
and other local collectors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Blaise.</span>&mdash;This station has only come
into prominence since the operations for the "Correction des Eaux du Jura"
took effect on the lake; and although its investigation has been
somewhat desultorily conducted, the finds from it are extremely
interesting, as they are characteristic of the period of transition.
The settlement, was situated to the west of the town of
St. Blaise, and appears to have occupied a large area, as piles
extended more or less all the way to Hauterive. Its chief
explorers and relic-holders are Messrs. Vouga, Zintgraff, and
Dardel-Thorens. In 1878 Dr. Gross published a description of
its relics with two plates of illustrations, and subsequently a
notice of it appeared in the <i>Anzeiger</i> (B. 376a) and <i>Das
Ausland</i> (B. 418, p. 49). Among some thousands of stone
axes, of which about ten per cent are perforated, there are
many of nephrite, jadeite, chloromelanite, and <i>saussurite</i>. These
latter are generally small, and set in horn fixers with a split
at the end. The perforated hatchets (one of which is an unfinished
specimen, with the core still in the hole) have often
one end formed into a hammer (<b><a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a></b>,
Nos. 25 and 26). Among the many worked objects of horn and bone,
such as pins (Nos. 22, 23, and 24), perforated clubs (No. 20), and
daggers or spear-heads (No. 21), are some curiously-wrought
pieces, which suggested to Dr. Gross the idea that they were
part of a machine for boring holes in hard substances. The
chief interest, however, lies in the number and variety of copper
objects which this station has yielded. Out of about a dozen
articles of metal, only one is said to be bronze (No. 4)&mdash;a
dagger with a well-defined mid-rib&mdash;while the rest consist of two
flat axes (Nos. 6, a fragment, and 14), six daggers after the
type of the flint weapons (Nos. 1 to 5, 7, and 9), a knife
(No. 8),<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
a bit of a spiral (No. 18), an arrow-point with some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
asphalt still adhering to it (No. 16), two small awls (Nos. 15
and 17), two earrings (Nos. 11 and 12), and two beads (Nos. 10 and 13).</p>

</div>

<p class="space-above1">One of the copper daggers was mounted in a handle
of withes, the remains of which are still to be seen (No. 2), and
strongly reminds one of the flint daggers when similarly
mounted, as seen in No. 28. As ornaments from this station
I have figured a fossil ammonite and a smooth stone, both
perforated (Nos. 27 and 19). Two fossil shells, an ammonite
(<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 23), and pectunculus, are described
in the Ninth Report on the Pfahlbauten (B. 462) as coming from Oefeliplätze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hauterive.</span>&mdash;Opposite the village there was a very large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
settlement, which has yielded a considerable number of antiquities
of a mixed character, chiefly dispersed among the Museums
of Neuchâtel, Bern, Bienne, and Zürich. Col. Schwab found
two iron spear-heads and pottery. After Schwab's investigation,
Desor searched the station and found a steinberg. Among the
more interesting objects are:&mdash;a small figure shaped like a duck
and ornamented with strips of tin (<b><a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a></b>, No. 13);
a vase, also ornamented in the same way (<b><a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a></b>, No. 6);
a disc of bone ornamented with concentric circles, and some bronze pendants
(<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>, Nos. 13, 14, and 16). In Bern there
are four pins with large heads, and several tanged knives, sickles, bracelets,
pendants rings, fish-hooks, etc.; also dishes of fine black pottery with
round bottoms.</p>

<p>Between this and Neuchâtel are three stations, viz. Champréveyres,
Monruz, and Crêt, on which a few objects have been
picked up. In 1885 a pot of dark pottery ornamented with
circular lines and triangles ("<i>Wolfszahn-ornamenten</i>"), measuring
6&frac14; inches in diameter and 4&frac34; in height, was fished up in eight
feet of water, and was supposed to be from the bronze station of
Champréveyres.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The pot contained sand and the following
objects:&mdash;two stone celts, a spindle-whorl, a pierced boars tusk,
half of a stone axe-hammer partially bored, two objects of stone,
a bit of red ochre, and a bit of yellow ochre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auvernier.</span>&mdash;In the sheltered bay between
Colombier and Auvernier was one of the largest and most interesting
settlements in the lake. It was discovered early, and notwithstanding
that its remains were covered with ten or twelve feet of water,
it was minutely searched. Professor Desor ascertained that there
were two distinct stations near the same place, one being a
bronze station and farther out in the lake. The Stone Age
settlement, which lay just between the latter and the shore,
contained a steinberg of round and angular stones, and covered
nearly two acres. The piles of the bronze station were inserted
in soft mud, and their tops projected from one to two feet
above the lake bottom. In one place a canoe and large masses
of wattle-work were seen by Desor protruding from the mud.
Among the antiquities collected by the earlier explorers are:&mdash;Arrow-points
of various shapes with and without barbs, a richly-ornamented
socketed lance-head, a solid ring armilla, a chisel,
fish-hook, etc. Also fragments of variously-ornamented pottery,
one of which showed something like the Greek pattern or
meander line. Not less than twenty of the illustrations of Desor
(B. 95) are of objects from this station.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
The station was systematically investigated during the year
1873 and the three following years, and a report of the results
was published by Dr. Gross in 1876. (B. 286.) He describes
the antiquities under the following heads, from which it will be
seen that the station ranks almost on a par with that at
Moeringen:&mdash;(1) Arms, (2) instruments, (3) objects of dress, (4)
objects belonging to horses' harness, (5) moulds, (6) pottery.
Dr. Gross, at the eighth meeting of the German Congress of
Archæologists at Constance, in September, 1877, gave some further
account of the relics from Auvernier, particularly the swords, of
which six were found. (B. 306.)</p>

<p>The illustrations on <b><a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a></b> include a variety
of axes (Nos. 1 to 8), knives (Nos. 9 to 11), a socketed chisel (No. 12), a
gouge (No. 18); three hammers, one with a square socket and a
side loop (No. 13), another with a square perforation in the
middle (No. 19), and the third shaped like the upper portion
of a winged axe (No. 20); two sickles (Nos. 15 and 16), a star-like
ornament (No. 14), pendants (Nos. 17 and 24), half of a
mould for an axe (No. 22), and an ornamental object (No. 27).
All the above are of bronze, and of the remaining objects, one
(No. 23) is a trilocular dish of pottery, two are of bone (Nos. 25
and 26), and the last (No. 28) is a stone anvil set in a wooden
casing. The handle of one of the swords is illustrated on
<b><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a></b>, No. 3.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cortaillod.</span>&mdash;We next come to the neighbourhood
of Cortaillod, where there were several settlements. From Mr. A. Vouga's
admirable and concise notices (B. 393 and 414a) of the more
recent discoveries, it appears that the principal station (Station
Principale, marked a on the accompanying <a href="#Map_3">Sketch Map</a>)
was nearly opposite the village of Petit Cortaillod, and consisted of two
portions&mdash;one, nearest the shore, furnishing relics of the Stone
Age; and the other, those characteristic of the Bronze Age. A
few hundred yards to the north there was another large Stone
Age settlement (Station de la Fabrique, <b>b</b>), also with a Bronze
Age portion on its outer or lake side. On the south side of the
principal station there were observed two small groups of piles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
probably remains of embryonic stations which were never completed
(<i>c</i> and <i>d</i>). On one of these a remarkable wooden implement,
supposed to be a pile-driver, was found, measuring 5 feet 4 inches
in length (<b><a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a></b>, No. 4).</p>

<div class="figright">
  <a name="Map_3" id="Map_3"></a>
  <img src="images/i_085.jpg" alt="_" width="250" height="244" />
</div>

<p>The first exploration of the settlement commenced in the spring of
1858, when Mr. Troyon, after examining the stations near Yverdon,
visited the locality and fished up five bracelets of bronze,
together with some hair-pins and a few small rings, which are now in
the Museum of Lausanne. Mr. Burki, of Petit Cortaillod, also found
several bronze objects, some of which he sold to Agassiz.</p>

<p>These respective successes induced Col. Schwab and Prof.
Desor to direct their attention to Cortaillod, who, in the course
of a few years, made a collection of very remarkable objects.
Among these the following are worthy of note:&mdash;a bronze wheel,
19&frac34; inches in diameter, with four spokes (<b><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></b>, No. 17);
the surplus jet of a bronze casting, broken off apparently after the
operation was completed; several half-moon and other variously
shaped pendants (Nos. 10, 12, and 21); bracelets (No. 14); a massive
ring ornamented with concentric circles (No. 15); some large-headed
pins, earrings (No. 7), studs (No. 22), hatchets, sickles, fish-hooks,
beads of amber and glass, a spoon of terra-cotta, etc.; but the most
novel were dishes, particularly a large plate ornamented with tin
strips arranged in various patterns of lines, circles, and the Greek
meander (<b><a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a></b>, No. 2).</p>

<p>Of the four brothers Kopp, who worked for these antiquaries,
one afterwards commenced on his own account and sold the finds,
and in this way many of the relics went to other localities. In 1874
a necklace of bronze was found (<b><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></b>, No. 3),
which Mr. Vouga states is still in the possession of a gentleman at Auvernier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
In 1876 a fisherman found a sword, which he sold to the keeper of the Museum
at Bale (No. 19).</p>

<p>Meantime the Stone Age portion of the principal station was
little examined, as the relics were deeply buried. Here, however,
were formerly found some iron objects of the La Tène type, viz. a
sickle (B. 31, Pl. xiv. 20), and a stone anchor with iron hoops,
now in the Museum Schwab. In 1878, when the Government drainage
works began to tell on the lake, many articles were picked
up. Thereupon Messrs. Vouga and F. Borel commenced systematic
diggings, and this set an example to the authorities of the
Museum of Colombier and the Société du Musée de Boudry, who
likewise started operations with a gang of workmen. Among
the objects collected up to 1883 Mr. Vouga particularises the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;A number of sharpening-stones of sandstone; a
large hollow stone for bruising corn, measuring 1 foot 6 inches
by 1 foot 9 inches, and 5&frac12; inches in thickness, having a hollow
2&frac12; inches in depth; some hundreds of hammer-stones, corn-crushers,
etc.; portions of stone showing marks of having been
sawn, and perforated net-weights; also spindle-whorls, an oval
hammer of serpentine ornamented with chevrons; some perforated
stone axes, etc.; about 1,200 plain axes, nearly a third of which
were still in their horn fixtures. Most of these horn fixtures
were inserted in wooden handles, but of course all traces of the
latter were generally gone; only 12 nephrite implements were
among them. About 1,500 chisels or small celts, only a few of
which were of jadeite. One celt was of flint, a very rare thing in
this district; and an arrow-point was of polished serpentine. Many
thousands of implements of various coloured flints&mdash;saws, knives,
scrapers, daggers, and arrow and lance-heads. The arrow-points
were generally triangular without wings, and a few were lozenge-shaped.
The largest flint dagger measures 9 inches in length
(Museum Colombier); and some of the saws were still fixed in
their handles with asphalt when found.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i>&mdash;Some 3,000 fixtures for stone hatchets, of which
about one-third were perfect. These implements are not
bifurcated at their end, as is often the case with those found
at Auvernier and elsewhere; and many are only partially made,
so that one would suppose there had been here a factory for their
special manufacture. There were also perforated hammers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a great number of chisels, pointers, etc.; also some large plaques
whose use is unknown. Out of twenty barbed harpoons one, 8&frac12;
inches long, has twelve barbs (No. 8), and one (now in the Museum
Boudry) is unfinished. About a similar number of pendeloques
or beads, and a few small objects like arrow-points.</p>

<p><i>Bone.</i>&mdash;A great number of pointers and chisels, some of
which were inserted into handles; quantities of awls, lance-points,
and javelins; thirty daggers; some twenty perforated
teeth of the wolf or dog; fifty tusks of the wild boar worked,
and some set in handles; bundles of pointed ribs (flax-heckles).</p>

<p><i>Wood.</i>&mdash;An oval cup of yew, 4 by 2&frac34; inches; others were
found, but not preserved. A small hammer, and bits of basket-work.</p>

<p><i>Metal.</i>&mdash;A small round copper armlet, and a flat bronze axe
with a round cutting edge.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Fragments of a coarse ware, found everywhere
and generally indicating roughly-made vessels; and a few perforated
weights, cylindrical and round.</p>

<p>As the waters became lower, the bronze station became
more accessible, and accordingly its investigation was begun by
Messrs. Borel, of Boudry, and Kaiser, of Estavayer. Among
the antiquities collected here are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;Several hatchets and knives; four razors, of
different types (one hammered from the fragment of a bracelet); five
sickles; a bracelet ornamented with lines and concentric circles,
and another closed (No. 13), also ornamented; three small
bracelets; some buttons, studs, etc.; the tip of a scabbard (No. 5);
several lance-heads, one ornamented (No. 4); two fibulæ (No. 6);
many hair-pins, several hundreds of fish-hooks; a necklet made of
twenty bronze rings, connected by a chain of copper; and a
cup, now in the collection of Dr. Gross (No. 20).</p>

<p>Among other relics were fragments of cups, vases, and other
dishes of ornamented pottery, some twenty clay supports, and
hundreds of spindle-whorls, etc. No. 11 represents a pendant,
the substance of which no one can determine, as it is neither
stone, bone, horn, nor pottery.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1884 the water was unusually low, and
the piles, being left high and dry, presented such a singular
appearance that many visitors were attracted to see the novel
sight. Many objects were then picked up. One bracelet, ornamented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
with concentric circles, was sold for eighty francs. Among the
other objects described by Vouga are the following: A large
fish-hook (No. 2), 4&frac34; inches long; a piece of wood surrounded
by two bands of copper; a bronze pin with perforated head, and
another with flat head; a small vase with four holes (No. 9), a
small lamp with a handle like a spoon, and a bronze pendant
formed of eleven massive rings (No. 1).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bevaix.</span>&mdash;Several stations were known here
at an early period, and some of the objects from them have been described
by Troyon, Keller, and Desor. They consist of bronze celts
(Nos. 16 and 18), sickles, hair-pins (Nos. 23 and 24), bracelets
(No. 26), a razor (No. 25), clay rings, etc., which are now in
the collections of Schwab, Desor, and others.</p>

<p>Since the lowering of the water in Lake Neuchâtel, the Messrs.
Borel have systematically investigated and reported on the stations
in the Bevaix district. (B. 445.) From La Tuilière to Treytel, a
shore-line of about two miles, they describe seven separate localities
containing stations, chiefly of the Stone Age. An excellent
map accompanies their description; and had they added a few
illustrations its value would have been greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>One of the greatest drawbacks to outsiders who wish to master
the archæological results of the Swiss lacustrine investigations
is the want of a correct map showing the area and distribution
of the respective stations; and if this desideratum is ever to be
supplied for those lakes that have come under the influence of
the Correction des Eaux du Jura, there is no time to lose, as
most of the stations are now on dry land and nearly obliterated
by vegetation; and it is a work that can only be done by local
archæologists, like the Messrs. Borel, who for years have had
practical knowledge of the stations in their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The accompanying <a href="#Map_4">Sketch Map</a> (after that of Messrs. Borel)
shows that, while the foundations of the two Bronze Age stations
are still in the lake, all those of the Stone Age are entirely on
dry land. This distinction was long ago pointed out by Desor
and others, but it was only since the lowering of the lake that
such a practical demonstration became possible.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The Messrs. Borel premise their acquiescence in the
proposed subdivision of the lacustrine Stone Age into three periods,
viz. a first or early period ("période d'établissement et de formation"),
characterised by rudeness and simplicity of industrial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
remains; a second ("le bel âge de la pierre"), showing commercial
and agricultural progress, and especially great skill in the manufacture
of all manner of stone celts; and a third ("une période de
transition"), which witnessed the introduction of metals among
the lake-dwellers.</p>

<p class="center">Sketch Map of the shore of Lake Neuchâtel, near Bevaix,
showing the relative positions of the stations of the Stone and Bronze periods.</p>
</div>

<p class="space-above1">Typical examples of all these periods were found on the
Bevaix district, as will be seen from the following notes, taken chiefly from
the data supplied by the Messrs. Borel:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) <i>Station de la Tuilière.</i>&mdash;This settlement belonged to
the earliest lacustrine period, and, being much exposed to the winds,
appears to have been quickly abandoned. The piles are much
decayed and difficult to find, and the relics are few in number,
and of a primitive type. Only rude stone axes, a few weights,
and flints of a dark colour, are recorded.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Station des Vaux.</i>&mdash;Between La Tuilière to the Station
des Vaux the promontory "Du Grain" intervenes, where, scattered
on the shore on both sides of it, Roman tiles are met with. The
remains of this pile-dwelling are situated near to a small spring
of water, and directly below the rising ground, which is here
covered with vines. The piles are disposed in two groups, and
with scarcely an interval between them; but they represent two
different periods of the Stone Age. The first or more eastern
group stretches for 100 yards, with a breadth of 40 yards, parallel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to the lake; and though farther within the old lake basin, it is considered
by Messrs. Borel the older of the two, being contemporary
with La Tuilière and the earliest lacustrine settlements in the
lake. A steinberg of broken stones marks its centre, but its
examination has yielded only a few small stone celts, arrow and
spear-heads of dark flint, and some coarse pottery. Among the
osseous remains are some jaws of the beaver.</p>

<p>The second group occupied a smaller area than the previous
one, and contained no steinberg, but, on the other hand, a well-developed
relic-bed, some 12 to 16 inches thick, which was productive
of relics of a decidedly more advanced character, such as
well-made implements of staghorn, including a variety of handles
for stone celts. The most important discovery here was a human
skull of the dolichocephalic type. (<i>Antiqua</i>, 1884, p. 106.)
The most inland piles of this group were only about 30 yards from
the vineyards, whereas the corresponding ones of the first group
were 70 yards distant. The anomalous statement that the second
or more advanced Stone Age settlement was situated in an outer
zone from the earliest (a fact which applies to all those explored
on the Bevaix coast), Messrs. Borel explain by supposing that the
lake area was gradually increasing since the earlier settlements
were founded. We shall afterwards see that this supposition is
well founded, on evidence that by careful observation could be
greatly multiplied.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Station de l'Abbaye.</i>&mdash;A little farther on there
is the site of another Stone Age station, presenting the same
indications of an older and younger period, and also having the
same relative position to each other as we have seen in the
Stations des Vaux, viz. the older occupying a situation more
advanced into the old lake basin. In front of these two
stations, Des Vaux and De l'Abbaye, lie the remains of a large
settlement of the Bronze Age, the piles of which, even when
the lake is at its lowest, are still in several feet of water; it
extends parallel to the shore, about 200 yards in length, and
160 in breadth. In addition to the relics found by the earlier
explorers (Troyon, Desor, Vouga, Dr. Clement, etc.), and already
noticed, the following bronze objects are recorded from the
station, all of which are either in the private collection of the
Messrs. Borel or in the scholastic museum at Bevaix:&mdash;</p>

<p>Six celts (one of which is socketed), portion of a sword
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
scabbard, four chisels (some prettily ornamented), five sickles,
twenty fish-hooks, three bracelets, two razors, 105 hair-pins (all
sizes and forms), five pendeloques, two earrings, two buttons,
two finger-rings, twelve large and 195 small rings, etc. Among
the other finds are fragments of ornamented pottery, a clay
support-ring, three glass beads, weights, sharpening stones, etc.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Station du Chatelard.</i>&mdash;This station contained a steinberg
covering an area of 3,000 or 4,000 square yards, and was joined
to the shore by a tongue of land, on which a series of stepping-stones
were placed. The relics discovered on its site include
some 200 stone celts (ten of which are jade), forty staghorn
handles and fixers for celts, chisels, stone hammers, flint
implements, etc. The special characteristic of the station is the
appearance of the following bronze objects among these relics
of the Stone Age, viz. a small perforated plaque, two hair-pins,
four small daggers, three flat celts. Mr. Borel states that other
celts of this type were found, one being to his knowledge in
the possession of Mr. Rousselet, and one in each of the Museums
at Neuchâtel, Bern, and Zürich. One here figured
(<b><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></b>, No. 18) is from the Schwab Museum
at Bienne. Hence this station belongs to the period of transition, and is
in many respects comparable to the Station des Roseaux at Morges.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Station du Moulin.</i>&mdash;Proceeding about 600 yards
farther west we come to an isolated station of the Bronze Age, the
piles of which are still over 50 yards from the present shore;
and before the lowering of the water its site would be covered
by about 16 feet of water. Owing to the scarcity of relics
on this station, the duration of the settlement is supposed to
have been short. Desor found here some ornamented specimens
of the large hollow bracelet. Mr. Borel has only one small
specimen and a portion of a large one of this type. The other
objects of bronze are a couple of fish-hooks and a few pins and
earrings. Fragments of pottery are, however, proportionally
more abundant, among them being a vase, of elegant form, and
polished exteriorly by graphite. To the east of this station a
fine canoe was found in 1879, measuring 26 feet in length,
now deposited in the Museum at Chaux de Fonds.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>(6) <i>Station du Port.</i>&mdash;The remains of this small station, which
are exclusively of the Stone Age, are distributed on both sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of a small stream which enters the ancient port of Bevaix.
From the character of the relics the Messrs. Borel think that
the portion on the east side belonged to the first lacustrine
period, while that on the west was later. It would appear
that the settlement had been dwarfed by the adjacent great
palafitte at Treytel.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Station de Treytel.</i>&mdash;This station presents a fine example
of the second Stone Age period. Its <i>débris</i> is found on the
exposed shore, extending upwards of 300 yards in length, and
covering an area of some 8,000 to 10,000 square yards. It was
first examined in 1857 by M. Rousselet, who, notwithstanding
its being then submerged, made the fine collection of
objects from it now in the Museum at Neuchâtel. The flint
implements are particularly well made, and the raw material,
which shows a fine yellowish and partially transparent flint, is
supposed to have been imported from Gaul. The horn handles
and fixers for the stone celts are of varied forms, and there is
also a rich assortment of other relics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chez les Moines.</span>&mdash;Here there is a steinberg,
but the antiquities found are unimportant, only a few staghorn implements
and some stone celts. Fragments of Roman tiles were also found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Aubin.</span>&mdash;This station was near the shore,
and contained a vast steinberg measuring 300 feet by 200. Its investigation
was chiefly due to Dr. Clement, of St. Aubin, who made a
splendid collection of its antiquities, which show that the
settlement belonged almost exclusively to the Stone Age. Specially
noteworthy among them are flint-saws in yew and staghorn
handles; arrow-points, with portion of the shaft still attached
with asphalt; a few beads&mdash;one of glass and two of amber;
three small gold ornaments; perforated teeth of the bear and
wolf or dog. Many of the objects from Dr. Clement's collection
are illustrated in the second and third volumes of <i>Matériaux</i>,
pages 511 and 259 respectively; as well as in Keller's reports.
The horn fastenings are extremely varied, and those for celts,
intended to be used with wooden handles, terminate either in a
split or are squarely cut. The bone implements are particularly
well made, and many of the pointers are fixed into handles.
The arrow-points are also well chipped, and are of a longish or
triangular shape. In the Zürich Museum there is a beautifully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
chipped dagger of flint, over nine inches in length, from this
station. (See <b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concise.</span>&mdash;Mr. Rochat, who first examined
the remains of this settlement, describes a semicircular steinberg which
occupied part of the station. (B. 34.) The convex part looked south
and towards the lake. Its length was 459 feet, and breadth
255 feet, and when the lake was at its lowest (before the
Correction des Eaux du Jura) its top was only a few inches
below the surface of the water. The relic-bed was superficial,
but the piles penetrated deeply into the mud. During the
construction of the railway in 1859, which here passed through
a small bit of the lake, a dredging machine was used, when
antiquities of all kinds were collected in hundreds. These were
generally sold on behalf of the workmen, and hence the objects
from Concise are widely distributed, some having gone to
America. On and around the steinberg the antiquities were of
the Stone Age. Here the operation of dredging was carried on
for six weeks amidst great archæological excitement, which led
to the production of many falsifications. (B. 28, 31, and 39.)
Among the vast quantity of industrial remains brought to light,
there were objects of very diversified kinds, but all in this part
of the station were peculiar to the Stone Age; such as saws,
knives, and arrow-points of flint; hundreds of stone hatchets,
mostly of serpentine, only two or three being of nephrite;
perforated stone sinkers and hammer stones. Of bone and horn,
there were chisels, pointers, daggers, harpoons, cups, etc. Among
the pottery were circular dishes with perforated knobs, small
and large vases, plates, and cups; also some vases with conical
bases, with their corresponding clay rings. Clay balls, of the size
of two fists and perforated, reminded Mr. Troyon of similar
objects from Wangen.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Among the animal remains were three fragments of human
skulls and two jaws. Also one tooth of the horse.</p>

<p>During the last few days of these operations the dredging
machine was shifted in a north-eastern direction, and here
objects of bronze were turned up, such as hatchets, hair-pins,
knives, buttons, spirals, beads, rings, etc.</p>

<p>It would thus appear that there were two stations&mdash;one of
the Stone Age, and the other of the Bronze Age; or that a
portion of the former survived during the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>It was in the vicinity of this station that Captain Pillichordy
in 1832 dredged up a canoe and two beautiful bronze swords,
only one of which is now known to exist in the Museum of
Neuchâtel. In September, 1889, Dr. Evans showed me, among
many other objects from the Swiss lacustrine dwellings, a
sword from Concise, purchased by him in Paris in 1887, which
at once struck me as being the other weapon which so mysteriously
disappeared in 1832. The handle and the tip of the blade
of this sword are here represented (<b><a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a></b>, No. 24),
and when compared with the drawings of its supposed fellow at Neuchâtel
(B. 34, Pl. iii. 35; B. 119, 2nd ed., Pl. cii. 17; B. 31, Pl. xi. 11;
and B. 252, Pl. v. 10), their remarkable similarity will be at once
seen. That in Dr. Evans's collection has a total length of 26&frac12;
inches. The blade is of yellow bronze 21 inches long, and
terminates in a somewhat rounded point.</p>

<p>In the months of January and February, 1885, a portion of
the station hitherto unexamined became dry, and a great many
objects were found, including bronze pins (<b><a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a></b>,
Nos. 2, 3, 8, 10, and 11), hatchets, bracelets, sickles, knives, pendants
(Nos. 9 and 13), tin wheels (No. 4), wooden combs (No. 7), and
vases, etc. Among the more remarkable objects described and
figured by Mr. Vouga (B. 414d) are:&mdash;A necklace made of rolled
bands of bronze, forming tubes, and ornamented with hollow lines
(No. 1). Some of these tubes are of gold, and interspersed with them
are three buttons of bronze and a number of small blue beads.
Two bracelets or closed rings, ornamented (No. 6); a ring with a
prominence inside; and a curiously-wrought pendeloque (No. 12).
These objects are mostly in the possession of private collectors.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Onens.</span>&mdash;Two stations are situated near the village
of Onens&mdash;one (Stone Age) to the east of the village, and the other
(Bronze Age) to the south. The former, now entirely on dry land, has
been little explored, being for some time covered with vegetation.
"Je crois," says M. de Meuron, "cependant qu'elle a dû être
importante d'après son étendue et la quantité de cailloux éclatés
que recouvrent le sol. Cette station appartient à moi; mais la
végétation y est devenue si belle que je la laisse pour les
générations futures." (B. 462, p. 47.)</p>

<p>On the bronze station several remarkable pendeloques in the
form of thin discs of bronze were found some years ago, which
are now deposited in the Museum at Neuchâtel; and since this
discovery it has been partially explored by M. Morel-Fatio,
Dr. Brière, and others. M. de Meuron states that he is in
possession of a few objects from this station, viz. hatchets, chisels,
bracelets, and a magnificent lance-head 10 inches in length. From
Onens comes the leaden cake with suspension loops similar to
those from Wollishofen (<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, No. 24). Illustrations
of some of the bronze discs are given on <b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>, Nos. 1 to 3.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corcelettes.</span>&mdash;Two groups of piles were
observed by the early explorers, one to the east and the other to the west
of the village of Corcelettes, and a number of antiquities both of the
Bronze and Iron Ages were collected. The station, however, was
never systematically examined till the lowering of the waters in
1876, when it was found to be one of the most prolific and interesting
in Lake Neuchâtel. The portion since then investigated
is described by Dr. Gross as lying immediately before the village,
and 2 kilomètres from Grandson. It extended about 200 mètres
in length and 100 in breadth. The relic-bed was thinly covered
with sand, and varied much in thickness, from a maximum of
3 feet in the centre, to the margin where it thinned out. The
bronze relics collected here are thus estimated by Dr. Gross
at the twelfth meeting of the German Anthropological
Society:&mdash; <a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
60 hatchets, 4 hammers, 30 sickles, 60 to 70 knives, 10 swords
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
(three of which are complete), 150 entire armillæ and many fragments,
20 lance-heads, 12 discs (phalères), 300 to 400 hair-pins, 3
vessels, 11 moulds (one of bronze and 10 of sandstone), besides
a quantity of smaller objects, as buttons, pendants, rings, etc.
Together with beads of glass and amber, small tin wheel-shaped
objects, there were some 300 entire vessels of pottery, some ornamented
with tin strips, crescents, etc.</p>

<p>The bronze hatchets were mostly of the usual type, i.e. with
four wings and a side loop; four were socketed, but not one of
the flat type.</p>

<p>Daggers were apparently rare at Corcelettes, as only one
example was found, with rivet-marks and slightly ornamented
on one side.</p>

<p>The knives were generally small, but one measured 10&frac12; inches
in length, and a few had solid handles beautifully ornamented.
Razors were numerous; one was made of a broken bracelet,
another was double-bladed and showed a break which had been
neatly mended with bronze wire. Horse-bits were of bronze and
horn. The bronze hollow armlets are beautifully ornamented, and
in the interior of some of them were observed bits of wax, supposed
to be the remains of a central core of this material which
had been used in the operation of casting.</p>

<p>It is singular that among the many ornaments from this
station there is not a fibula, except a portion of one which is
claimed as an importation from Scandinavia (<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>, No. 19).</p>

<p>Of wood there were:&mdash;A round oak table; a small box,
8 by 2&frac12; inches; and a portion of an oar.</p>

<p>Of the three bronze dishes, one has a handle attached by
rivets; and of the other two (which are in the Museum at
Lausanne), one is of northern origin (<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>, No. 20).</p>

<p>Corcelettes, like most of the other Swiss lake-dwellings, was
destroyed by fire, in proof of which Dr. Gross points to a mass
of bronze objects, in a half-molten condition, consisting of three
hatchets, four bracelets, a lance-head, and a sickle.
(Figured in B. 392, Pl. xxii. 12.)</p>

<p>One of the largest collections from Corcelettes is in the
Museum at Lausanne, of which I have made the following jottings:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;The bottom of a vase marked with the tips of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
potters fingers; some dishes ornamented with herring-bone
patterns (<b><a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a></b>, No. 22), and others with circular
grooves, each having a small perforation like one at Constance (No. 21); small
toy cups, three of which are bilocular; clay rings, with dishes to
fit them; two figures of animals; bits of clay-walling with marks
of round timbers.</p>

<p><i>Wood.</i>&mdash;Fragments of basket-work, two shaped handles of
wood for sickles, fragments of wooden dishes (one with handle).</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;Of about 100 large hollow bracelets more or
less perfect, some 50 are ornamented with transverse lines; the rest
have various designs of lines and circles. A few bracelets are
solid, and more or less penannular, with pointed or expanded
tips. Four bracelets are of double wires, one of which is spirally
grooved and ends in a hook and eye. Of six small socketed
hammers, three have side loops, and all are more or less rectangularly
shaped. Among 60 hatchets, only six have sockets, and nearly
all have side loops, but no terminal catch. Two have the side
loop transverse to the cutting edge.</p>

<p>Of 78 knives, nine are socketed, three have solid handles,
apparently as part of the blade, and the rest have tangs (three
being bent into a loop at the top).</p>

<p>Among some hundreds of pins, only seven or eight have
perforated heads.</p>

<p>Of three horse-bits, one is entire (<b><a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a></b>, No. 8);
and of the others, only the twisted central portion remains
(<b><a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a></b>, No. 23). Moreover, there are
14 perforated portions of horn, supposed to have been parts of bridles.</p>

<p>Among the special objects from this station is a slender bronze
rod terminating at each end with a movable ring, somewhat
like the beam of a balance (No. 16). In the Museum at Boudry
there is a curious ornamental tube of bronze (No. 20).</p>

<p>In 1888 Dr. Brière communicated a short note to <i>Antiqua</i>
(B. 463a), in which he enumerates the following objects as the
most interesting among recent finds:&mdash;A bracelet of lignite
(No. 14), a tin wheel (No. 5), an amulet of bronze like the
casing of a pair of spectacles (No. 15), a large bronze knife with
a horn handle (No. 19), an amulet of staghorn (No. 17), a bead
of amber suspended by a twisted bronze wire (No. 18), and a
complete bridle-bit of horn (<b><a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a></b>, No. 1).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Les Uttins</span>
(<span class="smcap">Yverdon</span>).&mdash;At the foot of Mount Chamblon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
rather more than a mile from the lake, there are some peat
deposits, which the peasants have been in the habit of utilising
as fuel. Here in two spots, according to Mr. Rochat,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
the peat-cutters are reported to have met with piles and transverse
beams with mortices. The tops of the piles were 6 to 10 feet below
the surface. A flint arrow-head, two stone celts of serpentine,
and a bronze bracelet, were found in one of these bogs; and
hence Messrs. Troyon and Rochat (B. 31, p. 70) consider that
there was a palafitte here&mdash;a supposition which involves the theory
that the lake formerly extended to the locality. Nor is this theory
without some evidence in support of it, as the amount of <i>débris</i>
brought down by the Thielle is very great. On the supposition
that the Roman city of Eburodunum, the ruins of which are
now 2,500 feet from the present shore, was built on the lake in
the fourth century, Mr. Troyon calculates that the water of the
lake would have been as far back as the site of the palafitte
about fifteen centuries before the Christian era.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clendy, Cheseaux, and Chable à Perron.</span>&mdash;Along
this part of the shore there were three or four settlements with steinbergs,
but the piles are now destroyed, and the few antiquities collected
belong apparently to the Stone Age. Chable à Perron covers an
area of some 3,500 square yards, but the only antiquities found
were serpentine hatchets and their horn fixings, some flints,
pointed bones, and fragments of coarse pottery. (R. 336.)</p>

<p>Some interesting notes of the early researches and discoveries
made on the various stations in the vicinity of Yverdon are
given by Mr. Rochat in Kellers third report on the Pfahlbauten.
(B. 34.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Font.</span>&mdash;On this station a cup-marked stone
was found, and Troyon records several objects&mdash;a curious bronze needle,
Roman tiles, and Imperial Roman money&mdash;as coming from the same
place. Professor Grangier, of Fribourg,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
found here some Roman medals, together with an iron arrow-head, iron keys,
and subsequently an oar.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
He states that the whole coast, from Font to
Estavayer, was occupied with piles, and that he attempted to
make a plan of the stations, but gave it up, because the configuration
was constantly changing. The original conditions were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
also entirely altered by the number of piles extracted by the
fishermen. He knew one family who for two generations had
never used any other firewood but piles extracted from the
lake-dwelling stations. One place, about half-way between Font
and Estavayer, was well known for its antiquities, and went among
the fishermen under the name of "La Pianta." (B. 178, p. 169.)
In the Fribourg Museum there is a considerable number of bronze
objects from Pianta, some of which are here figured (<b><a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a></b>,
Nos. 1 to 10, and 24). I have also noted three stone moulds
(two of wheel pendants), and an ingot of bronze. Some pins
and a knife are in the Bern Museum.</p>

<p>Mr. Forrer gives some notes of the station at Font,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and figures some nephrite implements from "several hundreds"
collected here by Mr. Beck. Along with the usual chisels and
hatchets, there are in Mr. Beck's collection arrow-heads, knives,
etc.&mdash;objects rather rare of this material in the Lake of
Neuchâtel. Some of the hatchets are remarkable for their size,
one measuring 8&frac12; inches long, and others show great variety of colours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Estavayer.</span>&mdash;Mr. A. Morlot describes the
early investigations of the settlements at Estavayer and its neighbouring
shore in Keller's third report. (B. 34.) Systematic explorations were
conducted by MM. Béat de Vevey and Henri Rey, who collected a
large and varied assortment of relics, especially of bronze, many
of which are illustrated on Pl. v. Close to Estavayer there were
two stations&mdash;one of the Stone Age; and another, farther out in
the lake, of the Bronze Age. The former was parallel to the
shore, about 120 yards long and 60 broad. The relics here
found were of the usual Stone Age types&mdash;stone and horn
hatchets, flint saws, and arrow-points, etc. One finely-finished
hammer-axe has an oval perforation, an expanded cutting edge,
and a raised bead running along the centre of its anterior surface.</p>

<p>The Bronze Age settlement was some 400 feet distant from
the shore, in water six or seven feet deep. Consequently the
station is now, during low water, mostly on dry land. The area
of the station was estimated at 7,700 square feet. The following
is a list of the bronze objects collected by MM. de Vevey and
Rey, chiefly by means of pincers:&mdash;128 hair-pins (36 with
spherical and ornamental heads), 26 knives, 15 bracelets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
5 sickles, 1 socketed hatchet, 1 chisel, 1 fish-hook, 27 rings of
different kinds, 2 buttons, 1 dagger-blade, 1 arrow-head (socketed),
and 6 flattened wires coiled in the form of a spiral.</p>

All <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1869 Dr. Keller (B. 163) gives an account of further discoveries
at Estavayer, in which he mentions a small vessel of
fine clay, having a funnel-like opening and a spout below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
(<b><a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a></b>, No. 21); a hair-pin 5&frac12; inches long,
with the stem of bronze, and head of staghorn, intercepted in the middle with
a disc of silver; a bronze spear-head, with a spur on the stem,
supposed to have been used as a spear for fishing; a bronze
bracelet; and two tynes of staghorn&mdash;one perforated as for a
bridle-bit, and the other ornamented with concentric circles.
Professor Grangier, writing in 1878 (B. 313), describes the <i>tenevière</i>
of Estavayer as a peninsula, and gives an amusing description of
the searchers for antiquities.</p>

<p>About a couple of kilometres to the north-east of Estavayer,
and near the village of La Corbière, there was a large settlement
which also belonged partly to the Stone Age and partly
to the Bronze Age. The first is a steinberg, and bears the
name La Creuse or La Crasaz. (B. 414c.) On it, in addition
to the ordinary Stone Age objects, were found a Roman waterjug
and a fibula of the La Tène type (<b><a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a></b>, No. 26).
The part that has yielded bronze implements is farther out in the
lake, and from it Colonel Schwab and others collected a
considerable number of objects, among which were:&mdash;A bar of tin
6 inches long, a small bronze saw, a socketed arrow-head, a thin
armlet of bronze wire, a bronze nail, a discoidal stone, fragments
of pottery ornamented with strips of tin, etc. Near this in 1875
Professor Grangier discovered a curious object now supposed to
be the handle portion of an Etruscan chariot. (B. 270 and 336.)</p>

<p>There are thus three well-defined Bronze stations in the
vicinity of Estavayer, besides an equal if not larger number of
the Stone Age. The chief collection of relics from this part of
the lake of Neuchâtel is in the Museum of Fribourg, where I
have noted:&mdash;A double-legged pin (No. 11), portion of chariot
handle (<b><a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a></b>, No. 10), a small bronze cup, a perforated bronze
hammer (<b><a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a></b>, No. 20), a couple of socketed bronze axes
(Nos. 17 and 19), and a well-made arrow-point of flint (No. 25).</p>

<p>There are also many objects from Estavayer in the Cantonal
Museum at Bern, among which may be mentioned:&mdash;A bronze
fibula (No. 12), part of an ornamental chain of various sorts of
bronze links (No. 13), a socketed axe (No. 23), and three large
knives (Nos. 18, 30, and 31). The other illustrations are a bronze
pin with a spiral head (No. 28), a gold earring (No. 16), an amber
bead (No. 15), a bronze knife (No. 22), a bronze fibula (No. 14),
a pin with a flat head (No. 27), and a curious horn object (No. 29).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Implements like the latter are frequently met with in Swiss lacustrine
stations. They vary from a few inches up to twelve or more
in length, and are always curved and polished. In the Bern
Museum there are four from Gerlafingen, five from Schaffis, and
others from Sutz, Locras, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forel.</span>&mdash;Little was done to this station
till 1883, when the Fribourg Government granted free permission to the
searchers for lacustrine antiquities to collect on their portion of the
shore of Lake Neuchâtel. Since then many curious objects are reported
as coming from this station, but they are mostly held by private
collectors. Mr. A. Vouga gives some notes of these discoveries in
the <i>Anzeiger</i>. (B. 414.) He states that the relics are found on this
station in three different strata, the most superficial of which is
1 foot 6 inches deep, and the lowest 4 feet 8 inches.</p>

<p>Among the objects described and figured by Vouga are:&mdash;A
stone hatchet in its horn fixture, several hatchets of coloured
nephrite and one of green jade, perforated hammers and a cup
of horn; knives, pins, etc., of bone; a curved implement made
of the jawbone of a stag (<b><a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a></b>, No. 19). Some remarkable
objects made of horn or bone and ornamented with dots, circles,
etc., consisting of bracelets (No. 20), and pendeloques (Nos. 13,
17, and 18), have attracted the attention of critics, and the general
opinion is that they are forgeries.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chevroux.</span>&mdash;Troyon describes three large
settlements of the Bronze Age (B. 31, p. 150), near Chevroux, farther from
the shore than a Stone Age settlement, on which were found bracelets,
hair-pins, sickles, knives, two swords of bronze, and a great iron fork
(<b><a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a></b>, No. 15). In 1866, an object
(<b><a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a></b>, No. 10), described
by Keller as part of an Etruscan chariot, was found near this. (B. 337.)

</div>

<p>In the Museum at Lausanne there is a large collection of
objects, both of the Stone and Bronze Age settlements, from
Chevroux. Among the former are:&mdash;Two beautiful flint daggers
with thin handles of wood (<b><a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a></b>, No. 1), six
saws of flint in their handles, part of a wooden comb, three wooden dishes,
the club handle of a stone hatchet with the implement still in position,
bone pins with neatly-fashioned heads (Nos. 4 and 6), etc.
There are over 300 plain stone celts, and 30 perforated tools.
About 100 horn fixings, of which one-third have bifurcated tops.
Some celts have been identified as belonging to the following
substances:&mdash;chloromelanite five, three of which are in their horn
fixings (two bifurcated); saussurite, 14 to 20, one of which is in its
handle (square); jadeite 22 to 25, five in handles (two bifurcated);
nephrite 23 to 26, two in their fixings. There are also a few of
felsite, amphibolite, etc. About 100 flint arrow-points, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
same number of beautifully chipped flint arrow-heads (No. 5). Also
of horn there is a large number of chisels, pointers, hammers,
flax-hecklers, and some curiously-shaped perforated clubs of horn.</p>

<p>Among the pottery are some curious dishes, two of which are
here figured (Nos. 8 and 14), the latter being adorned with
string ornamentation.</p>

<p>Among the objects from the Bronze Age stations are:&mdash;Many
hair-pins, two phalères, five sickles, a few bracelets, one winged and
one flat hatchet, portion of a flat copper celt, a few knives with
tangs, six small daggers, and two remarkable pendeloques, one of
which is here figured (No. 3).</p>

<p>Mr. Vouga (B. 414d) describes some fine discoveries that
were latterly made on the Bronze stations. Among the objects
which have come under his notice are:&mdash;A razor with a curved
handle, 4&frac12; inches long (No. 11); a thick crescent, ornamented
with half-moons; a fibula (No. 10); a pin with spiral stem (9&frac12;
inches long) and perforated head (1&#8539; inch in diameter).
Another has a very large head (2 inches diameter), with 24
holes in it (No. 12). Other objects from this station are a comb
(No. 9), an amber bead (No. 7), a copper dagger (No. 16), and
a copper chisel (No. 2).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gletterens to La Sauge.</span>&mdash;Some eight
or nine stations have been noted by the earlier explorers along this part
of the coast, many of which have yielded Roman tiles and pottery. At Port
Alban there are the remains of a station on which bronze (No. 21) and iron
objects have been found. Recently there has been brought into notice a
kind of ornamental metal mirror, said to have been found here
(<b><a href="#Fig_192">Fig. 192</a></b>).<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Another site is farther east, giving indications of an early
Stone Age station, but on which Desor found iron objects.
Among recent finds are some large horn buttons and a so-called
"portemonnaie lacustre" (No. 22).<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>At Champ Martin there is a steinberg, on which spindle-whorls
and a few other things have been found.</p>

<p>At Cudrefin the lake-dwellings are unimportant, but the station
is well known as the site of a canoe, carefully described by
Professor Grangier. It measures 36&frac12; feet long, 2 feet 9 inches
broad, and 1 foot 6 inches deep. This dug-out, like so many in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Ireland and Scotland, had for strengthening purposes four transverse
beams left in the solid. The prow had a perforated beak,
which might have been used as a means for fastening a rope. (B. 194.)</p>

<p>At La Sauge fragments of Roman amphoræ and tiles were
found associated with some piles.</p>

<h3>LAKE OF MORAT (MURTEN).</h3>

<p>Lying directly between the lakes of Neuchâtel and Morat
there stretches a considerable elevation called Mount Vully, which
ends abruptly at its north-west end on the margin of the Gross
Moos. At the base of this declivity lies the Broye, and as the
widening and deepening of its channel was part of the great
scheme for the Correction des Eaux du Jura, a similar effect was
produced on Lake Morat as on the lakes of Bienne and Neuchâtel.
Previous to the lowering of its waters, however, the lake-dwelling
stations along its shores were carefully examined by Colonel Schwab,
Baron von Bonstetten, and the Count de Pourtalès, the proprietor
of an estate on its western shore.</p>

<p>In Keller's 5th report (B. 61) the number of stations in this
lake was given as 16, and since then one or two more have
been added to the list. Many of these were, however, mere
indications which, on the lowering of the level of the water, have
turned out to be only stone cairns supposed to have been landing-places.
According to the most recent researches of Mr. Süsstrunk
(B. 336 and 462), the number may be reduced to 11, the
positions of which are sufficiently defined on the accompanying
<a href="#Map_2">Sketch Map</a>. They belonged mostly to the Stone Age
period, and only three, viz. Montilier, Greng-Insel, and Vallamand survived
during the most flourishing period of the Bronze Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montilier.</span>&mdash;The first station of importance,
beginning on the east side of the lake, was situated a little to the north of
the present village of Montilier. It contained a steinberg, and
the piles were stout and firmly fixed. Here Colonel Schwab
found not only objects of the Stone Period, such as flint knives,
stone hatchets, etc., but also an unusually large number of handsome
earthenware vessels presenting a style of ornamentation
which at once led him to assign the settlement to the Bronze
Age&mdash;a deduction which his subsequent discoveries completely
justified. These vessels were neatly finished, and had their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
surface sometimes rubbed over with charcoal or graphite, a
process which gave them a glossy appearance. They were made
without the intervention of the wheel, and from not giving out
a ringing sound when struck with a hard substance, Colonel
Schwab concluded they had been burnt in open fires. The
ornamentation consisted of deeply incised lines, circles, triangles,
etc., filled with a white chalky substance. In some instances
strips of tin were plastered over the surface, which took the
place of the linear incisions, and so presented a pleasing combination
of the same principles of ornamentation. The forms of
the vessels are extremely elegant and varied, and may be classed
as <i>cups</i>, <i>bowls</i>, <i>plates</i>, <i>jars</i>, and <i>jugs</i>.
Some have handles, others spouts springing from the middle of the bulge,
and others a series of symmetrical perforations, but whether for ornament
or use it is difficult to decide. One most remarkable dish
like a saucer has its inner surface ornamented with linear incisions
and a series of thirty symmetrically disposed groups
of perforations. The colour of this pottery was either black, red,
or grey, and sometimes the same dish had a combination of these
colours. Spindle-whorls of diversified forms, and ornamented
with dots, oval depressions, etc., were also abundant, (B. 126,
Pl. iv. and v.)</p>

<p>Among the other Bronze Age antiquities collected here were
some stone moulds, hair-pins, hatchets, knives, armlets, rings,
sickles, fish-hooks, beads of glass and amber, a small flat finger-ring
of gold, etc. There was also portion of an armlet of tin. The
bronze knives were not numerous, but one was highly ornamented
with a series of three flowing patterns of semicircles separated
by incised lines which ran along its curved back.</p>

<p>No swords or bronze dishes are recorded from this station;
and of three bronze hatchets in the Murten Museum, of the usual
winged type, one has the loop transverse to the cutting edge,
and a portion of its wooden handle still remains between the wings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murten.</span>&mdash;This station lies a little above
the monument of the battle of Murten. It is of considerable size, and has
yielded a large quantity of Stone Age objects, such as large perforated
stone axes, staghorn hammers, flint arrow-heads, lumps of
carbonised wheat and many other seeds, weaving-weights, and
also bits of burnt cloth. The station is now completely worked out. (B. 61 and 462.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meyriez (Merlach).</span>&mdash;This station belongs
to the early Stone period, and no perforated axes are among its relics. Among the
few things collected on its site the following may be mentioned:&mdash;Bits
of cloth, burnt corn, stone hatchet in wooden handle, another
hatchet of jade, etc. The woodwork was very rotten, and the piles
could hardly be distinguished. A canoe with ribbed floor (now
in the Fribourg Museum) was found in the vicinity of the station. (B. 462.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greng-Insel.</span>&mdash;This settlement was situated
at the end of a low tongue of land which projected into the lake, and covered
an area of 49,000 square feet. Near the shore the relics were
entirely of the Stone Age, but farther out in the lake they
became mixed with bronze and even iron objects. During low
water, previous to the Correction des Eaux du Jura, a considerable
portion of this station could be visited on dry land, but
now it is entirely dry. In its vicinity are several stone cairns
which have greatly puzzled antiquaries, as no relics have been
found on them. Piles were observed in two of them&mdash;one lying
to the north-east and the other to the south-west of it.</p>

<p>When this station was first investigated (1861-2), it yielded
a number of perforated hammers and hatchets (some showing unfinished
perforations), six flint knives, corn-crushers, a stone mortar,
a bronze ring, a hair-pin, and several implements of iron. (B. 61.)</p>

<p>Subsequently the proprietor, Count de Pourtalès, with the
co-operation of the local archæologists, made further excavations,
which proved that it essentially belonged to the Stone Age.
From Dr. Uhlmann's Report (1865), it appears that the relic-bed
was from 1 to 4 feet below gravel and matted roots. The piles
were generally of oak-stems as thick as a man's arm or leg, and
some were as much as 1 foot in diameter, but when they reached
this size they were generally split. They were irregularly set,
and penetrated deeply into the mud below. They were of a
blackish colour, well preserved, and apparently pointed with
stone axes. Among the relics collected were daggers, saws, and
arrow-heads of flint, beautifully made (<b><a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a></b>, No. 9);
stone celts, neatly bored; implements of bone, as chisels, pointers, etc., and
staghorn haftings.</p>

<p>Fragments of pottery showed two qualities&mdash;a reddish thick
earthenware, badly burnt, and a finer quality with some linear ornamentation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>The bones turned up were very numerous; among which Dr.
Uhlmann recognised those of the following animals:&mdash;Urus (a
large variety of horned cattle) and the small <i>marsh cow</i>. The
sheep-bones indicated a large race with strong horn cores bent
backwards and outwards; but those of the goat belonged to a
more slender animal; stag, elk, and roe-deer. Amongst the carnivora
were the great bear, the teeth of which were perforated
for suspension, the dog (larger than at Moosseedorf), fox, hedgehog,
and beaver. Bones of the frog, and the scales and bones of
a fish, probably a species of pike. Also there were several
portions of skulls and other human bones.</p>

<p>Among vegetal remains were hazel and beech nuts, stones of
the sloe and birdcherry; seeds of raspberries, blackberries, and
strawberries; and carbonised masses of wheat. (B. 126.)</p>

<p>When the station became dry in 1874, in consequence of the
drainage-works, it was again investigated by Mr. Süsstrunk, on
behalf of the town of Morat and the Canton of Fribourg. Among
the objects then found were two flat celts, the composition of
which, according to Dr. v. Fellenberg's analysis, was a mixture
of carbonate of copper and sulphur, without any traces of tin.
Among other things were buttons and haftings of staghorn; a
conical stone set in a long hafting of staghorn; some netting-needles
of wood, etc. (B. 286.)</p>

<p>Since then a considerable number of the usual class of bronze
objects as hatchets, knives, hair-pins, fish-hooks, rings, etc., have
been found on this station. (B. 462.) Noteworthy is a knife, partly
of bronze and partly of iron (<b><a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a></b>, No. 1).</p>

<p>Among the objects in the Museum at Morat are clay weights,
dishes of pottery (Nos. 13 and 15), staghorn haftings (some with
a slit at their handle-end); a curious object of staghorn, like a
large earring (No. 17); beautifully worked flint daggers (No. 9),
and a large number of bone chisels, pointers, etc. In the
Museum at Bern there is a mould for a flat celt, with the
casting still in its case, like one in the Museum at Stuttgart
from the Ueberlingersee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greng-Mühle.</span>&mdash;The next station following
in the same direction is a large and prolific station of the Stone Age,
with staghorn implements predominating among its relics. The perforated
stone axes are wanting. (B. 462.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faoug (Pfauen).</span>&mdash;Near the railway station, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
course of digging a well, the relic-bed of a pile-dwelling belonging to
the Stone Age was encountered, but its contents have not yet
been excavated. A little to the west of this in the lake some
bronze objects were found associated with piles, but these relics
are supposed to have come from Vallamand. (B. 462.)</p>

<p>Near Faoug there was observed a curious wooden structure,
which Dr. Keller suggested might have been a circular lake-dwelling,
like the Irish crannogs. Mr. Süsstrunk wrote a short
notice of it (B. 336), in which he comes to the conclusion that
it was more likely to be in connection with fishing than with the
Pfahlbauten. It consisted of seven concentric circles of slender
piles, separated by an interval of from 2 to 3 feet. The
diameter of the largest circle was hardly 14 yards, so that little
space was left in the interior for any supposed dwelling. The
outer circle was formed of boards, about 10 inches broad and
2 inches thick, standing on end, and penetrating the soil to the
depth of 3 feet or so, and so closely set as to be almost touching.
The piles in the other circles were round and small, and their
ends penetrated only 18 inches into the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vallamand.</span>&mdash;This station was extremely
rich in Bronze Age objects, and was known to Colonel Schwab, who found many
vessels, clay rings, discoidal stones, a bronze earring, and a bronze
shallow plate, about 10 inches in diameter and 1 inch deep.
One of the fictile dishes (No. 16) is shaped like a water-bottle,
and has its neck perforated with a number of small holes
arranged at uniform distances and so as to be in perpendicular
line. From each hole a circular line runs round the neck.
(B. 61, p. 49.)</p>

<p>The station was finally explored in the interests of the
Museum of Lausanne, where there is now a splendid collection
of its relics. Some things, however, have gone to the Museum
at Bern and to that in the castle ruins at Avenches. One of
the most interesting objects from this station is a razor in
its wooden case (No. 8). In the Lausanne Museum the objects
are marked Guévaux, and among them are the following:&mdash;Of
bronze&mdash;four winged celts with side loops (two of which have a
terminal catch), three large hollow rings with linear ornamentations,
one bracelet, two cups ornamented with small repoussé prominences,
six sickles (two with a back spur and one with an upright spur),
a large cup-shaped head of a pin like the one from Wollishofen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
(<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 9) several pendants
(<b><a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a></b>, No. 10), involved
rings (Nos. 2 and 4), gouges, buttons (No. 7), studs, 1,300 rings found
together, combs (Nos. 11 and 12), and a curious rod hooked at
the ends and perforated (No. 5). A fish-hook with attachments
(No. 3), a pin with attached chain (only a portion of which is here
represented, No. 21), and a curious ornamented dagger, are from
other collections.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
A few specimens of pottery (Nos. 14 and 18) and an ornanamented
horn (No. 20) complete the illustrations from this station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guévaux, etc.</span>&mdash;The four stations on this
part of the coast&mdash;viz. Guévaux, Mür, Motier, and Sugiez-Zollhaus&mdash;have
furnished only a few traces of their existence, from which it would appear
that they belonged to the pure Stone Age.</p>

<p>The group of well-preserved piles at the mouth of the
Chandon was probably a Roman landing-stage, as Roman tiles
have been found along with them.</p>

<p>At Nant were found two kettles, one of bronze and the
other of copper with an iron ring, two daggers, some iron
arrow-heads, and a piece of sculptured marble, evidently
of a later period than the lake-dwellings.</p>

<p>Of the remaining eight or nine cairns whose tops were occasionally
above water, none have yielded industrial relics, and
there is consequently no evidence as to their age and use.
They are too small to admit of even a single hut. (B. 462.)</p>

<h3>INKWYLERSEE.</h3>

<p>The little lake of Inkwyl is surrounded by low pasture-land,
and in the middle of it there is a small circular island thickly
wooded, which in appearance suggests the idea of a Scottish
Crannog. Professor von Morlot first, in 1854, drew attention to
the probability of the island being artificially constructed, and
a short notice to this effect, which appeared in 1857 (B. 19),
induced Mr. Amiet, of Soleure, to make some excavations. In
the following year (1858) these explorations were continued by
Mr. Roth, the proprietor of the island. The result of their
operations<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
showed that there was originally on the site of this
island a pile-dwelling, which became subsequently a solid island,
now rising about ten feet above the surface of the water. The
island measured 90 feet by 80 feet, and in the interior of it,
some 6 or 7 feet deep, there was a rough platform of logs
supported on piles. The antiquities, collected immediately on
and underneath the platform, consisted of stone axes of nephrite
and serpentine, along with their staghorn haftings; corn-crushers;
flint arrow-heads; bone implements; perforated tusks;
fragments of pottery, both rough and fine; clay rings and weights;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
spindle-whorls; broken bones of various animals, such as stag, roe,
marsh pig, wild boar, ox, beaver, and some birds. (B. 22.)</p>

<p>In the superficial layers were found a bronze spoon, fragments
of Roman pottery and flanged roofing tiles, an iron lance-head,
and a spur, apparently relics of the Middle Ages.</p>

<h3>BURGÄSCHISEE.</h3>

<p>About half an hour's walk from Inkwyl there is a somewhat
extensive valley, in which lies the small Burgäschisee, whose
boggy margins were for some time surmised to contain the
remains of lake-dwellings, as several objects of stone and a couple
of bronze pins were found by peat-cutters. A few years ago the
matter was put beyond doubt by investigations conducted under
the superintendence of Dr. Uhlmann and Mr. Jenner. A series
of pits were dug in the peat along the shore of the lake, and at
a depth of 2 to 4&frac12; feet they came upon very rotten piles, and
a large assortment of the usual industrial remains of the lake-dwellers
of the Stone Age. The relics and osseous remains were
similar to those from Moosseedorfsee; and among the former were
stone axes, flint saws, scrapers and daggers, arrow-points, of flint
and of rock crystal, with traces of asphalt, and mealing-stones.
Also fragments of various vessels, one with a handle; implements
of bone and horn, as chisels, pointers, etc.; a rubbing
instrument, made of the underjaw of a beaver; forked implements
of ribs, etc.</p>

<p>Noteworthy is the fact that some stone relics show evidence
of having been sawn. A short notice of these discoveries is
inserted in the eighth report on the Pfahlbauten by Mr. Keiser,
of Burgdorf. (B. 336.)</p>

<h3>MOOSSEEDORFSEE.</h3>

<p>This settlement, known as Moosseedorf, was situated in the
marsh of Münchenbuchsee, about seven miles from Bern. The
small lake of this name is now nothing more than a moorland
tarn, surrounded by meadow-land and peat bogs. It is of an
oblong form, having its greatest axis (east to west) corresponding
with that of the valley. During the winter of 1855-6, in consequence
of a canal made for agricultural purposes, its usual level
was lowered some eight feet, and thus a considerable portion
of its peaty bed became exposed, and for the first time divulged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the existence of two prehistoric pile dwellings, one at each end
of the lake. The western, which was more satisfactorily investigated,
owing to its site becoming dry land, proved to be a small
parallelogram 70 by 55 feet. This area was occupied with
piles of entire or split stems of oak and other woods, and
leading from it and running to the shore, there was a kind of
faggot roadway of branches. The relics were found among the
piles and underneath a stratum of mud, containing the roots of
reeds and water-plants. This relic-bed varied in thickness from
5 inches to 2 feet, and contained stones, gravel, bones, charcoal,
etc., lying immediately over the shell-marl. The piles
penetrated into this shell-marl, but no relics were found in it.
During the succeeding ten years after its discovery, these settlements
and their industrial remains were carefully examined by
Messrs. Jahn, Morlot, and Dr. Uhlmann. (B. 19, 22, 34, 40, 126.)</p>

<p>The relics, most of which are deposited in the Bern Museum,
include a large assortment of industrial remains:&mdash;40 stone celts
(four of which are of nephrite), a number of stones perforated, and
one stone spindle-whorl; flint saws in handles; arrow-points of
bone, flint (one with barbs), and rock crystal; harpoons; horn
fastenings for celts, some with a bifurcated end; three horn cups,
all with a round hole at the edge; needles, gouges, chisels, and
pointers of bone; a comb made of yew, a fish-hook made of boar's
tusk, a skate from the leg-bone of the horse, pieces of cloth and
string, bits of wood perforated as for net-floats, rolls of birch-bark, etc.</p>

<p>Fragments of pottery had perforated knobs for suspension,
and some of them indicated large vessels&mdash;about 16 or 17 inches
in diameter. In 1868 Dr. Uhlmann found a fragment of pottery
having a perforated knob, and alongside of it, evidently for
ornamentation, there were triangular bits of birch-bark plastered
over the surface with asphalt. (B. 336, p. 37.) (<b><a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a></b>, No. 5.)</p>

<p>Two portions of stone sawn off show that the art of sawing
this material was then known.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Uhlmann's analysis of its flora and fauna
the following species were identified:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;Barley, wheat (<i>Trit. vulg.</i> and <i>compactum</i>),
pea, poppy, and flax (<i>L. angust</i>.); also the water-chestnut
(<i>Trapa natans</i>).</p>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;Among domestic animals were the dog, sheep, and
various kinds of ox. A few bones of the horse were also found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
among the osseous remains, but as it is not yet certain that the
horse was domesticated in the Stone Age, these might belong to
the wild species.</p>

<p>The remains of wild animals showed:&mdash;Bear, badger, polecat,
marten, wild cat, otter, fox, hedgehog, beaver, hare, squirrel, fieldmouse,
marsh pig, wild boar, elk, stag, roe, ox (<i>Bos prim.</i>), bison,
several kinds of falcons, owl, wild pigeon, crow, partridge, heron,
stork, sea-gull, wild duck, and teal; also those of the tortoise,
frog, toad, perch, carp, pike, and salmon. (B. 284.)</p>

<h3>SEMPACHERSEE.</h3>

<p>In 1806 this lake was lowered to the extent of 6 or 8 feet,
and on the shore thus exposed a number of piles became visible,
among which it was reported that there were Celtic weapons,
hair-pins, and other implements found. "Keltische Waffen, die
in vii Bande des Geschichtsfreundes beschreiben sind, Nadeln
und andere Gegenstände." (B. 15, p. 99.) But these notices and
relics of a past civilisation attracted little attention at the time,
and it was only in the light of Keller's discovery of lake-dwellings
that the recollection of the find at Sempach was revived and
properly interpreted. Colonel Schwab in his lacustrine peregrinations
extended his researches also to Lake Sempach, and
identified seven or eight stations along its shores, most of which
were then on dry land. These settlements were situated near the
following places:&mdash;Eich, Schenken, Inselchen, Mariazell, Margarethen,
and Nottwyl: and in all of them some antiquities either
of stone or bronze were collected. (B. 61.)</p>

<p>At the north end, near the site of the lake-dwelling at Mariazell,
but about 20 feet from the water and a foot underground, there
was a remarkable bronze hoard found. (B. 126.) At a short
distance from this there was a human skull disinterred, and along
with it a hair-pin and a bronze gouge; but whether or not these
objects belonged to the lake-dwellers it is impossible to say. Most
of the lake-dwelling remains from the Sempachersee are deposited
in the Museum of Lucerne, among which I have noted the following:&mdash;One
or two discoidal stones; a few clay cylinders with
everted edges; whorls of various forms and sizes, some ornamented
with lines and pitted impressions; pottery ornamented with lines
and triangles, finger-marks, etc.; and four beautifully-worked stone axes
(<b><a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a></b>, Nos. 8, 9, and 10). The bronze find from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Maria Zellermoos includes seven winged and two flat celts, a
chisel, two knives, one dagger with six rivets, four sickles (one
with back spur), and 13 flat bracelets. Some Roman keys, buckles,
a few yellow beads of glass (one of amber), etc., are mixed
with this find. Specimens of these bronze implements are given
on <b><a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a></b>, Nos. 1 to 7, and 11.</p>

<h3>WAUWYLERSEE. (B. 34 and 126.)</h3>

<p>To the west of the little Lake of Wauwyl there is an extensive
peaty plain, in which, upon the lowering of the lake for
further utilisation of the peat, the remains of some curiously-constructed
lake-dwellings were discovered. Wooden platforms
were met with, resting, not on piles, but upon a series of successive
beds of roughly-cut stems lying transversely to each
other, the lowest of which reposed on the lake-bottom. Between
these layers were branches and brushwood, mixed with clay, and
the whole mass was pierced with vertical piles, the tops of which
were at least a foot above the upper platform. These layers
were as many as five, and the total thickness of the mass when
exposed was about 3 feet, but there can be no doubt that,
originally, it would have been greater, as there had been
considerable condensation of the mass due to decay, especially of
the interposing branches. The uprights were not observed to have
been in any way connected with the platform, and the only
peculiarity in the method of their arrangement was that they
were more thickly placed at the corners, as if to keep the wooden
mass in position. These artificial structures measured only 10
or 12 feet square, but they were very numerous, and so close
that beams from one sometimes reached to the one next it. They
were found in various parts of the moor, but in one place they
were crowded into a rectangle measuring 90 feet by 50, which
was surrounded by several rows of upright piles, as if for
common protection. The upright piles were made of oak, alder,
or fir, and they penetrated deeply into the shell marl&mdash;the
stoutest being of oak, measuring 5 inches or more in diameter.
It is noteworthy that the lowest horizontal woodwork lay on the
shell marl, showing that these dwellings were constructed before
the peat commenced to grow. The peat is now at least 6 feet
thick., <i>i.e.</i> 3 feet of peat lying above the uppermost platforms.</p>

<p>No antiquarian remains were found underneath the wooden
structures, but mostly in the intervals between them, where the
objects lay almost directly over the shell marl. The settlement
appears to have come to an end before the Bronze Age, as no
metal object has been met with. A small glass bead is therefore
of interest, as showing that the colonists must have had
commercial relations with distant countries. Among the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
antiquities are the following:&mdash;Stone celts (some of nephrite) hafted
in staghorn fixings, and flint implements; chisels, pointers, flax-hecklers,
etc., of bone; a lump of asphalt, harpoons of staghorn,
knives made of yew, and various fragments of pottery with
perforated knobs. In the Museum of Lucerne there are a few
things, among which are one or two objects showing that the art
of boring stone was known (<b><a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a></b>, Nos. 1 and 2).</p>

<h3>LAKE OF ZUG. (B. 61 and 126.)</h3>

<p>The site of the first discovered settlement in this lake lay a
little to the north of the town of Zug. A section of some
excavations made for building purposes about 50 feet from the
lake showed first a bed of common mould 2&frac12; feet thick, then a
layer of sand and rolled stones 1&frac12; foot thick, after which came
the relic-bed&mdash;a blackish band of decayed organic matter, varying
in thickness from 8 inches to 1 foot, and containing the tops of
piles and various industrial remains. The heads of the piles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
were on a level, and in some places cross-beams were observed.
The relics include some stone hatchets, one fragment being of
nephrite; a few flint objects&mdash;lance and arrow-heads, and one knife.
There were also portions of sawn stones, apparently for making
implements. From a small collection of bones Professor Rütimeyer
identified the horse, cow, dog, marsh pig, red deer, roe,
and hare.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The surface of the soil where these discoveries were made
was about 15 feet above that of the water in the lake, which of
course would leave the relic-bed still on dry land&mdash;a peculiarity
which is accounted for by the reported deepening of the outlet
in former times. This explanation is very probable, as the
channel of the Lorze, which carries off the surplus waters of
Lake Zug, in passing through the town of Cham, bears evidence
of having been artificially deepened. The large amount of
detritus conveyed annually into this end of the lake also
satisfactorily accounts for the depth at which the relic-bed
lies below the surface.</p>

<p>Farther round the head of the lake, at Koller, near Cham,
another site was discovered, on which some excavations were
made, which revealed a relic-bed 3 feet below the surface.
The finds here were broken celts of serpentine, fragments of
pottery indicating large vessels. The present level of the lake
is 3 feet below this relic-bed.</p>

<p>A third station was at St. Andreas, the evidence of which
was the finding of a great number of stone celts, flint knives
and arrow-points, over a certain part of a cultivated field
bordering on the lake. Peculiar among the finds here are some
curious oval objects made of limestone, with a short neck
perforated (<b><a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a></b>, No. 8).</p>

<p>Traces of three other stations&mdash;viz. at Derschbach, Zweieren,
and Badeplatz&mdash;have been noted beyond Cham, but they have
not been carefully investigated. Pottery ornamented with
triangular lines and the "meander" pattern would seem to
point to a later period. (B. 126, Pl. iii.)</p>

<p>A few of the objects collected on these stations are in a
small museum in Zug; others are at Zürich; and in Bern there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
are 12 stone celts and one of copper, marked as coming from
the station at Lorze.</p>

<h3>BALDEGGERSEE. (B. 253 and 336.)</h3>

<p>In the year 1871 the proprietors of the land around this
lake reduced its level by drainage some 2&frac12; to 3 feet, in
consequence of which indications of lake-dwellings became visible
in the vicinity of the outlet. The piles were irregularly placed
along the shore, and spread over a wide range. In one place
the area attained a breadth of 400 or 500 feet, and again it
contracted and the piles only appeared in groups. In making
excavations, the tops of piles became more numerous, and at a
depth of 7 feet, beds of charcoal, containing nutshells and bits
of pottery, were encountered.</p>

<p>Professor Amrein, who conducted the investigations, could
distinguish two kinds of piles, some older than others. Horizontal
beams were seldom met with. There was no regular
relic-bed, as worked implements were found at all depths, from
1 to 8 feet. Some beautiful specimens of bone pointers and
serpentine chisels (<b><a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a></b>, Nos. 4 and 5)
were turned up from a depth of 8 to 10 feet. Beds of clay were occasionally
met with, and the piles appeared to have been arranged so as to
enclose square huts. In one of the trenches some stone celts
were lying on a bed of clay at a depth of 6 or 7 feet. One of
these was of a grass-green colour with a transparent edge, and
so hard that it could scratch glass. In an adjacent digging, at
a depth of 4 feet, a large flat stone, 2 by 1&frac12; feet, was found
resting on the tops of six or seven piles, which penetrated
through the bed of clay to the shell marl. The space between
these supporting piles was filled with clay, and around the stone
itself there were scattered bits of charcoal, fragments of pottery,
hazel-nuts, etc.</p>

<p>Professor Amrein concludes his report by stating his opinion
that this settlement was at its commencement a palatitte, and
that subsequently fascine structures were constructed over its ruins.</p>

<p>The relics collected are partly in the Archæological Museum
and partly in a small curiosity booth in the Gletscher Garten
at Lucerne. Among those in the museum are beautifully-formed
daggers and chisels of bone and horn (No. 6); four large
harpoons (No. 7) and a scoop of horn; two horn hammers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
(perforated), and three small cups of the same material (No. 12);
horn handles, etc.; rubbers, polishers, and celts of stone in large
numbers; two flat pebbles (perforated); and some fragments of stone
hammer-axes, one showing an effort to re-bore it (No. 3); several
bits of rock crystal and flints worked into saws, scrapers, and
arrow-points; fragments of pottery with knobs, and others ornamented
with groups of triangular lines, dots, etc., the forms of
which are extremely elegant (Nos. 9, 10, 11).</p>

<h3>LAKE OF GENEVA.</h3>

<p>Leaving the great Jura chain of lakes we come, after a short
journey through an upland glacial valley, to the Rhone basin
and the Lake of Geneva. On the supposition that this was the
route followed by the lake-dwelling founders, the first and most
natural position for a settlement would be the bay of Morges;
and it is somewhat singular that in this very place one of the
largest and most instructive settlements on this lake flourished
for successive ages. Here, within a few hundred yards of each
other, three sites have been discovered, whose respective remains
mark the progressive stages of civilisation evinced in the Stone
Age, the transition period, and the most flourishing period of the
Bronze Age. It will be therefore of importance to examine carefully
the facts disclosed by the repeated examination of these
typical stations before referring to the others in this lake. Nor
in selecting it am I deviating from the order of discovery, as
it was the earliest known and first examined in this part of
Switzerland, after Keller's observations and researches at Ober-Meilen
had roused the curiosity of antiquaries in the matter.</p>

<p>The existence of piles in the bay of Morges was known to
fishermen for a long time, but of course their significance was
not understood. However, on the 22nd of May, 1854, Messrs. Morlot
and Troyon examined the locality, and speedily demonstrated, by
the finding of actual industrial remains, that this had been the
site of a <i>habitation lacustre</i>. The part of the bay in which
these piles were observed was about 500 feet from the shore,
and in a depth of water which varied from 8 to 10 feet, even
when the lake was at its lowest. Under these circumstances it
will be readily seen that it was no easy matter to make investigations;
but, notwithstanding the difficulties involved, there was
no lack of energy among the local archæologists, who for many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
years systematically prosecuted the work of fishing up, by means
of hand-dredgers, nippers, etc., the submerged remains of these
lacustrine villages. Foremost among these explorers were the
MM. Forel, of Morges, father and son, whose reports and rich
collection of antiquities have chiefly supplied the facts now
communicated.</p>

<p>When Troyon (1860) published his well-known book on the
lake-dwellings (B. 31), considerable progress had been made in
the exploration of the station, and from the richness of the
finds it got the name of "La grande Cité de Morges;" but it had
not yet been ascertained that there were three separate stations,
much less that these stations represented different periods.
According to Troyon, most of the piles were of oak, and some had
planchettes to prevent them sinking too far in the mud. A
portion of one of these supports measured 13&frac12; inches long,
4 inches broad, and 1 inch thick; and contained two square-cut
holes 1&frac12; inch in diameter and 4 inches apart. The relics
found up to this period were of much interest. Among them
were bronze hatchets 4 to 7 inches long, mostly of the winged
type, only one having a socket. Of 13 knives, nine had tangs
and four had sockets. Two swords, one of which, with flat handle,
was whole; two socketed lance-heads; several bracelets of different
kinds; and a bronze mould for casting celts<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
(<b><a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a></b>, No. 8). Pottery, clay rings for supports,
discoidal stones with marginal grooves, spindle-whorls, a couple of canoes, etc.
Subsequently the MM. Forel began to distinguish the respective stations, to
which they gave the following names:&mdash;(1) "La grande Cité de
Morges," (2) "La Station des Roseaux," and (3) "La Station de l'Église."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

and St. Prex (12). Nos. 7 and 8 = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>,

</div>

<p>(1) The Grand City was some 500 feet from the shore, and
occupied an area 1,200 feet long by 100 to 150 feet broad. The
stumps of its thickly-studded piles were visible in the water
never less than 8 to 10 feet deep, and among them were detected
some cross-beams, and a canoe, 2 feet wide, with its prow sticking
out of the mud. A large and miscellaneous assortment of relics was
also collected. Over 450 bronze objects, says Dr. Forel, writing
in 1876 (B. 286), were found on this station, and they all belong
to the purest type of what Desor calls "le bel Age du Bronze,"
including swords, knives, sickles, hair-pins, bracelets, etc. One
remarkable observation then made was that among 60 bronze winged
celts (Nos. 13 and 14) there was not one single specimen of the
flat kind. In 1866 two large reniform rings, one ornamented
(<b><a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a></b>, No. 3) and the other plain, were added to the list of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
objects from Morges. Only one object of iron, viz. a poignard,
analogous to one from Lake Bourget, was found. Among the
osseous remains the stag, goat, sheep, horse, and pig, were identified.</p>

<p>The bronze objects from this station up to the present date
are thus enumerated by Dr. Forel (B. 462, p. 55):&mdash;</p>

<p>Winged celts, 66; socketed celts, 6; chisels and gouges, 6;
swords, 4; lance-heads, 19; knives, 61; sickles, 23; bracelets, 95;
rings, 79; hair-pins, 256; divers, 23. In this total of 633 objects
are included, probably under the head "épingles," five curious
objects of bronze with handles similar to those from Wollishofen
and Grosser Hafner at Zürich. (B. 280, p. 699.)</p>

<p>(2) About 450 yards from the northern extremity of the
Grand City there was another settlement (Roseaux), of smaller
dimensions, which has yielded objects essentially different from
those of the former. Here, in marked contradistinction to the
Grand City celts, there were 18, all of which were of the flat
type (No. 15), and not one with wings or sockets. But, on the
other hand, there were a few polished stone celts and flint objects,
three small lances, and one hair-pin of bronze, and a few iron
sickles of modern type. The pottery was also of a mixed character,
showing fragments of dishes of a coarse and fine kind. The
piles showed marks as if produced by metal tools.</p>

<p>(3) The third station (l'Église) lies between the shore and the
Grand City, and is separated from the latter by a sterile band
220 yards wide. Here there is a decided steinberg, presenting
the unusual feature of having 20 or 30 rectangular or oval spaces
measuring 13 to 20 feet in diameter without any stones. The
antiquities from this station were stone celts (of which 86 are
recorded by Dr. Forel up to the present date), stone spindle-whorls,
sharpening stones, and some fragments of coarse pottery; but no
objects of metal of any kind.</p>

<p>(4) A fourth station is named by Dr. Forel as lying opposite
the ancient <i>poudrière</i> of Morges, and containing a small steinberg,
on which six stone celts and a few other objects of the Stone
Age have been found.</p>

<p>The search for lacustrine remains in other parts of the lake
was so actively prosecuted that Troyon could enumerate no less
than 26 stations discovered during the six years prior to 1860.
(B. 31, p. 31.) Since then their number, as recently corrected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
by Dr. Forel (B. 462), has increased to 44, notwithstanding that
eight localities (viz. Villeneuve, Creux de Plan, Lutry, Pully,
St. Sulpice, Yvoire, Amphion, and Evian) where supposed lake-dwelling
remains have been found are excluded as doubtful or
not verified by subsequent investigations.</p>

<p>Though no such fortuitous circumstance as the "Correction
des Eaux du Jura" has come to the assistance of the <i>lacustreurs</i>
of Geneva, they have amassed a very considerable quantity of
relics. Only at a few stations, as Thonon and the Port of
Geneva, have they benefited from dredging operations carried
out for public works. From the results obtained during these
favourable conditions, it is quite clear that an enormous quantity
of antiquities, especially of the Bronze Age, still lies buried in
the waters of this lake.</p>

<p class="space-above1">We shall now make a tour of the lake, jotting
the various characteristics of the lake-dwelling stations as we move
along. (See accompanying <a href="#Map_5">Sketch Map</a>.)</p>

<p>Above Morges are four stations, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de Cully.</span>&mdash;Some piles to the east
of the town, but in water from 10 to 13 feet deep. Only a few isolated objects
of stone and bronze have been recorded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de la Pierre de Cour.</span>&mdash;Near
Lausanne, at a large erratic block known to bathers as Pierre de Cour,
there are a few rows of piles in a depth of 13 feet, and at a distance
of nearly 300 yards from the shore. A hair-pin and two small bits
of bronze are the only relics recorded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station du Flon (Vidy).</span>&mdash;A number of
discoidal stones with marginal grooves, and some stone rubbers and polishers,
are recorded from this station. (B. 22.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de la Venoge.</span>&mdash;To the east of the
embouchure of the river, near St. Sulpice, and greatly covered by detritus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morges.</span>&mdash;Four stations, already noticed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frai d'Aïgue.</span>&mdash;In the gulf of Frai d'Aïgue,
a little to the north of St. Prex, are three stations&mdash;viz. De Terreneuve,
De Monnivert, and De Frai d'Aïgue&mdash;extending over a length of
one kilomètre. They all belonged to the Stone Age, and represent
probably parts of one and the same village. Mr. Colomb has collected
more than 200 stone celts in various grades of manufacture in a space
of 150 square mètres. From the same station there are in the Museum
of Lausanne some 40 stone celts, a few flint flakes and knives, and a spindle-whorl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Prex.</span>&mdash;In the gulf to the south
of St. Prex there is a station of the Bronze Age, the piles of which
are to be seen in a depth of 10 or 11 feet of water. The station has
yielded a considerable number of relics, some of which are deposited
in the Lausanne Museum, viz. a flat bronze celt (<b><a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a></b>.
No. 12), clay support-ring, portions of clay crescents, seven stone
celts, three or four fragments of pottery ornamented with curved
lines and cable pattern (one fragment of black pottery is ornamented
with tin strips), a bronze pin with spherical head, a large block for
sharpening tools. The other bronzes known from the station are four
knives, one bracelet, five rings, and 11 pins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rolle.</span>&mdash;Situated opposite this town
there appears to have been a lacustrine village of considerable size,
which has yielded objects characteristic of both the Stone and Bronze
Ages. Part of the area occupied with piles has been covered over by an
artificial island, now bearing a monumental <i>obélisque</i>. Fragments of
pottery of the same character as those from Morges, discoidal stones,
hammer and sharpening stones, were among the relics.</p>

<p>Dr. Forel enumerates the bronze relics from this station as
follows:&mdash;Two winged hatchets, one chisel, one lance, two knives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
one sickle (now in the Lausanne Museum), one bracelet, 15
rings, and nine hair-pins. (B. 462.)</p>

<p>To the south of this is the <i>Station de Beaulieu</i>, of considerable
extent, but poor in relics, only some 10 bronze objects having been
found on it. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station du Châtaignier.</span>&mdash;A small Stone
Age station before the village of Dully. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station du Creux de la Dullive.</span>&mdash;A great
circular station of the Bronze Age, on which two winged celts, two bracelets,
and a few rings and hair-pins have been collected. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nyon.</span>&mdash;According to Dr. Forel (B. 286),
there are two stations in the bay of Nyon&mdash;one at Promenthoux
(Stone Age), to the right of the embouchure of the river; and the
other (Bronze Age) to the north of the town of Nyon. Mr. A. Revilliod
found on the latter station a remarkable object, consisting of 300
rings of bronze, from 7 to 8 inches in diameter, which became adherent
to each other by a concretionary deposit from the lake. The total
number of bronze relics from Nyon is 62, thus relegated:&mdash;Seven
winged celts, one chisel, one lance-head, 10 knives, two sickles, 15
bracelets, 23 hair-pins, and three undefined objects.</p>

<p>We now enter the lower portion of the lake, where its breadth
becomes suddenly contracted from 8 to 3 miles; and here it would
appear that the lake-dwellers had thickly planted their peculiar
villages on both sides of the lake. Along the shore, from Nyon
downwards to where the Rhone makes its exit, and then up on
the other side to the opposite point of Ivoire, Dr. Forel (B. 462)
enumerates no less than 22 stations, in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de Céligny.</span>&mdash;Just
before the landing-pier. Bronze Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de Coppet.</span>&mdash;Discovered
in 1874 by M. Magnin. Bronze Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de Mies.</span>&mdash;Discovered in 1877,
opposite the Château des Crenées. Bronze Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de Versoix.</span>&mdash;A great station near
the landing-pier. Bronze Age. Hatchets and knives of iron are said to have
been found on this station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de Bellevue.</span>&mdash;Discovered in 1880,
to the north of landing-pier. Bronze and Stone Ages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station des Pâquis.</span>&mdash;Extends southwards
from the jetty of the new port. Stone Age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station des Eaux-Vives.</span>&mdash;Outside the port,
along the suburb of this name. Stone Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cité de Genève.</span>&mdash;A vast station occupying
the present port. Bronze Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de Plongeon.</span>&mdash;At the northern
end of the Station des Eaux-Vives, in a contracted spot, Dr. Gosse
has found some 30 objects of iron, some of which resemble those of La Tène.</p>

<p>The last four are generally known as the Stations of Geneva,
so that the lower extremity of the lake must have been actually
studded with settlements. At the foot of the largest of the two
well-known and superstitiously-revered boulders called Pierres à
Niton were found, about the middle of last century, a knife
(<b><a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a></b>, No. 5) and a celt of bronze of the
flat type, which are still preserved in the Museum of the town. Near this
was the Bronze Age station called by Dr. Forel "Cité de Genève," but
sometimes described as the Station des Eaux-Vives. It would
appear that there are two stations described under the latter
name&mdash;one of the Stone Age, about 100 yards nearer the shore;
and the other of the Bronze Age ("Cité de Genève").</p>

<p>The Cité de Genève is now the richest bronze station hitherto
investigated in the Lake of Geneva. It occupied a horseshoe-shaped
area, filling the entire space presently forming the port,
and even sent a prolongation down to Rousseau's island. Dr.
Forel estimates the number of bronze objects collected here at
1,500, being rather more than the total number from all the
other stations in the Lake of Geneva.</p>

<p>At its northern extremity, next the Station des Eaux-Vives,
Dr. Gosse came upon what must have been the site of a foundry.
Here, in a confined space not exceeding 100 square yards, he
fished up no less than 50 stone moulds, crucibles, ingots of
bronze and tin, scoriæ, and other materials of the founder's
art. (B. 462.)</p>

<p>Most of the objects of general interest from this station have
been deposited in the Archæological Museum. Dr. Forel classifies
those of bronze as follows:&mdash;25 winged hatchets, 19 socketed
hatchets, four flat hatchets, seven chisels and gouges, four swords,
seven lance-heads, 72 knives, 22 sickles, 75 bracelets, 230 rings,
1,000 hair-pins, and 60 diverse objects. In looking over this
collection I made the following notes:&mdash;The socketed celts have
the loop generally at right angles to the cutting edge. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
knives are both socketed and tanged. Bracelets show a great
variety of forms, but the solid ones predominate. Sickles have
more frequently a raised button. The ceramic art shows the
usual Bronze Age decoration of triangles, and the paste is of
two qualities. Clay ring-supports, spindle-whorls, discoidal stones,
etc., are very abundant. Among the odds and ends are to be
noted pins with large perforated heads, fish-hooks, buttons, a
large plaque with repoussé work of slightly-raised bosses, a rude
image like a stag of bronze, a variety of pendants, small tin
wheel-like objects in concentric circles, etc. A few of these objects
are represented on <b><a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a></b>, all of which, except
Nos. 9, 10, 12, and 13, are from this station and deposited in the Museum at Geneva.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de la Belotte.</span>&mdash;A large
station, rich in Stone Age relics. A couple of bracelets and a few
rings and hair-pins of bronze, in all 21 objects, are among the
treasures from this settlement, which comprise no less than 1,400
stone celts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de la Pointe de la Bise.</span>&mdash;Immediately
to the north of La Belotte there is another station, said to be one of
the transition period, owing to its having supplied a couple of flat
axes. The only other metal objects are a few rings and hair-pins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station de Bellerive.</span>&mdash;A large station
yielding objects both of the Stone and Bronze Ages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gabiule.</span>&mdash;Before the steamboat landing-stage
are two stations&mdash;one of the Stone Age; and another, in deeper water,
of the Bronze Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station d'Anière (Bassy).</span>&mdash;A small Bronze
Age station in deep water.</p>

<p>We next come to a group of four stations, all within a compass
of two miles, which are sometimes confounded with one another,
and described as "Les Stations de Tougues." One is near Hermance,
and is known as the Station de la Vie à l'Ane or du
Moulin; a second is vis-à-vis de la Fabrique Canton; a third
is opposite the Château Beauregard; and a fourth, Creux de
Tougues, lies before the village of Chens. These settlements
were all parallel to the shore, and their remains are in deep
water. Their relics are of a mixed character, and would indicate
that, while founded in the Stone Age, they subsisted during that of Bronze.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
The station at Creux de Tougues is the most important of
the group, and it has furnished a large number of antiquities.
It is about 130 yards from the shore, in a depth of water varying
from 5 to 10 feet. Ordinary stone celts, 27 of which have been
collected (B. 462), were found on the part next the shore. The
collection of bronze objects consists of:&mdash;Four winged celts
(<b><a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a></b>, No. 10), one flat celt, two socketed chisels,
one sword, one lance-head, 21 knives, five sickles (No. 9), 14 bracelets,
120 rings, 170 hair-pins, and six diverse objects. Pottery from
this station (Nos. 12 and 13) comes largely to the front, and in
the Museum of Geneva there are fine specimens of plates, cups,
vases, and other vessels of a fine black ware which, both in form
and ornamentation, resemble those from the palafittes of Lake
Bourget and others of the Bronze Age in Switzerland. Spindle-whorls,
discoidal stones with a marginal groove, rubbing stones,
etc., are also abundant. A peculiarly-shaped stone object known
as "gorge de poulies" comes here to be noted. (B. 31, 281 and 462.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messery</span>.&mdash;Piles are here seen
projecting above the mud 2 to 5 feet, in a depth of about 12 feet of
water. One of the piles pulled up by Troyon showed markings of a metal
tool. Numerous fragments of pottery characteristic of the Bronze Age
have been found, but only two objects of this metal, viz. a winged
celt and a sickle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nernier.</span>&mdash;Two stations are
described in the vicinity of the village of this name. One, near
the shore, and partly covered up with gravel, belonged to the Stone
Age. Here Troyon observed some large piles in a depth of 6 feet of
water, and others he found on the shore buried in the gravel. Among
the objects collected are flint flakes, spindle-whorls, hatchets of
serpentine (a perforated one is in the Museum of Annecy), some worked
bones, etc.</p>

<p>The Bronze Age station is 600 yards to the west of the
village, and 150 from the shore. The relics consist of pottery,
spindle-whorls, ring-supports, etc. Among the bronze objects are:&mdash;Eight
winged celts, two chisels, one sword, two lance-heads, three
knives, three sickles, five bracelets, three rings, and five hair-pins.
Among the rings is included a pendeloque, in the form of a
large hollow ring, attached to which is a small ring for suspension.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stations d'Excenevrez et de Coudré.</span>&mdash;In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
rounding the point of Ivoire we come to a sheltered bay, into which a
couple of streams discharge their waters, carrying down a considerable
amount of <i>débris</i>, so that the lake-dwelling remains
are here deeply buried. Traces of two stations have, however,
been observed, one, station De Moulin-Pâquis, near Excenevrex,
and the other, De Coudré, opposite Château Bartholoni, not far
from the village of Sciex. Both appear to belong to the Stone
Age, and in the latter, in 1874, 12 stone hatchets were found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thonon.</span>&mdash;There were two separate
settlements at Thonon. One (Stone Age), about 20 yards from the shore,
was discovered in 1862, when the new port was being formed. The
objects there collected were piles, flint implements, stone hatchets,
spindle-whorls, and some coarse pottery.</p>

<p>The Bronze Age station was considerably in advance of the
former, and in a depth of 3 to 4 yards. The settlement was extensive,
and ran parallel to the shore, and from its remains a large
assortment of relics has been collected. Being among the earliest
discovered in the Lake of Geneva, it has been industriously
searched by a number of well-known archæologists, as Troyon,
Forel, Revon, Monod, Revilliod, Carrard, etc., and consequently
its treasures are widely distributed. The bronze objects, according
to Dr. Forel (B. 462), amount to 48, viz. 11 winged celts, two
lance-heads, six knives, two sickles, 14 bracelets, two rings, five
hair-pins, and six diverse objects. One of the knives, which is
finely ornamented and one foot in length, has the peculiarity
that the handle contains less tin than the blade (<b><a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a></b>,
No. 16). Another knife was adapted for side-plates to be riveted
on its handle (No. 11); while others were socketed and tanged
(Nos. 17 and 18). Some of the hatchets have a side loop, and
others are devoid of it. Among other things are a large ring,
<i>armilla sacra</i> (Carrard), (No. 2); a pendant of three involved
rings, together with various other pendants (No. 9). Among
the pottery are fragments with perforated knobs, herring-bone
pattern (No. 1), etc.; and some charming vases, clay ring-supports, etc.</p>

<p>There are thus, according to Dr. Forel, 11 stations of the
Stone Age; three of the period of transition (<i>i.e.</i> with hatchets
of bronze of the flat type), six with mixed objects, 19 of the
Bronze Age, and one (Station de Plongeon) which furnished
objects characteristic of the early Iron Age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>These notes have been collected from a fragmentary and
widely-scattered literature, including the following original
sources:&mdash;B. 22, 31, 34, 40, 121, 126, 138, 152, 280, 282,
286, 315, 377, and 462.</p>

<h3>LAKE LUISSEL, CANTON DE VAUD.</h3>

<p>In a small valley among the heights above Bex, adjoining the
Rhone valley, there were found, in 1791, while a canal was being
dug for facilitating the cutting of peat, some industrial remains
which point to the existence of a lake-dwelling of the Bronze
Age. At the north of the basin, and at a depth of 6 feet, a
quantity of bones (some human), grains of corn, bronze rings, the
tip of a scabbard, and three remarkable swords (from 23 to 26
inches in length) were encountered (<b><a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a></b>).
The swords are still preserved, and indubitably belong to the most flourishing
period of the Bronze Age. In the summer of 1859 Mr. Troyon made
excavations in the turf of the former bed of this lake, but found
only a portion of worked wood, which might have been used as
a handle for a stone hatchet. According to an old tradition in
the neighbourhood, a château once existed here which had been
engulfed in the lake. (B. 31.)</p>

<h3>LAKE BOURGET.</h3>

<p class="space-below1">As early as 1856, while the Mont Cenis and Culoz
railway was being constructed, some antiquities were dredged up in the
bay of Grésine, in Lake Bourget, which the engineers surmised
to be remains of a lake-dwelling. Though this information was
formally communicated to the Société Savoissienne, it was not till
1862, in consequence of renewed attention to these discoveries by
Baron Despine and M. Desor, that this society took steps to
investigate the matter. A preliminary investigation conducted
by a committee of seven gentlemen was considered so satisfactory
that the committee was renewed, with funds at its disposal for
systematic researches among the palafittes. Since then several
archæologists have conducted independent researches, among
whom may be noted particularly Le Comte Costa de Beauregard,
MM. Rabut, Perrin, Revon, Cazalis de Fondouce, and Chantre.
(B. 73, 138, 176, 179, 282.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Map_6" id="Map_6"></a>
  <img src="images/i_135.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="200" />
</div>

<p>The combined results of these explorers have now established
the fact that there were eight settlements in this lake, all of
them belonging to the Bronze Age. The antiquities fished up have
been very numerous, but unfortunately they are widely distributed,
many indeed being in private collections. The largest proportion
is, however, to be found in the Museums of Chambery, Aix-les-Bains,
Annecy, and St. Germain, and the private collection of
Count de Beauregard in his château on the Lake of Geneva.
(For relative position of these stations see
<a href="#Map_6">Sketch Map of Lake Bourget</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjux.</span>&mdash;This station is 200 yards from
the shore, opposite the village of the same name. A group of piles only 50
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
yards from the shore is supposed to have been the ruins of a
Roman pottery business, on account of the abundance of
characteristic ware found among them. A peculiarity of this
station is the number of moulds found on it in proportion
to the other objects, no less than 13 being recorded up to
1875, representing all manner of industrial implements, as
knives, winged and socketed celts, sickles, hammers, pins, rings,
and buttons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chatillon.</span>&mdash;This settlement occupied a
sheltered position about 500 feet from the shore. In one part the piles
project out of the mud, and are all inclined towards the east at an
angle of 45°, but in the rest of the station they are straight. A
vessel of earthenware, like the later productions of the lake-dwellers,
was found among these piles with the name Severinus
stamped on it in Roman characters. (B. 176, p. 24.) Here were
found some 40 or 50 of these very remarkable vessels of black
earthenware, ornamented with tin strips forming a combination of
pleasing designs (<b><a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a></b>, Nos. 4 and 5); also
some fragments of Gallo-Roman pottery, and others of a very early type. Among
the relics are eight moulds (one of which is for a lance-head)
and about 320 objects of bronze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gresine.</span>&mdash;The bay of Grésine contains the
sites of two settlements&mdash;one close to the railway, and the other farther
out and of larger extent. The latter appears to have been connected
with the Pointe de Grésine, as a gravel bank runs from this part
of the shore to the site of the palafitte; and the two stations
were connected with a gangway, the remains of which have been
traced. The railway just touches the site of the inner station,
to which accident the discovery of palafittes in Lake Bourget is
due. Although the stations at Grésine have been more frequently
searched than any others, owing to their proximity to
Aix-les-Bains, they have continued for a long time to be the
richest in all kinds of antiquities, carbonised fruits, etc. Among
the moulds is one for the handle of a sword on one side, and
a buckle on the other. (B. 282, Pl. liv. 2.) No less than
five bronze hammers have been found on this station, all of
which are socketed and cylindrical in shape. Last summer
some remarkable objects were fished up, which I saw in the
collection of the finder at the Restaurant Lacustre (Port Puer),
some of which are here figured (<b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>, Nos. 4, 6, and 12).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meimart.</span>&mdash;The <i>débris</i> of this
settlement lies about 100 yards from the shore, under 16 to 20 feet
of water, and hence it has been less searched, although it is of
considerable extent, and has yielded a few antiquities, notably a
bronze sword, moulds, fragments of pottery, and a Roman vase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Le Saut.</span>&mdash;This settlement, like
the others, was on a slight elevation some 110 yards from the shore,
and at low water its relics have to be fished from a depth of about
10 feet. The station has been well explored, and it has been observed
that the ceramic remains indicate greater technical skill the farther
out in the lake they are picked up, and where the piles are seen to
project higher above the mud. A piece of timber 22 feet long, with
numerous mortises at each end, and a bone harpoon with one barb, like
those of bronze from Peschiera, are the only objects which distinguish
the antiquities of this station, which in general are very similar to
those from Grésine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Les Fiollets.</span>&mdash;A small settlement
in 15 to 20 feet of water. The few bronze objects found here are
covered with calcareous matter. Some of the pins collected on it are
of novel forms, but the most interesting object is a small file, which
may be seen in the Museum at Chambery. Mortised beams were also fished
up from this station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charpignat.</span>&mdash;Some piles have been
observed near the village of Bourget, but the associated industrial
remains, if any, have not yet been revealed.</p>

<p>In 1875 Mr. Perrin made a series of elaborate statistics, by
which he estimated the entire number of bronze objects from
the palafittes in Lake Bourget at a little over 4,000, and tabulated
them in various categories according to their uses, indicating
the stations on which they were found, and the museums
or collections in which they were then located. (B. 282.) Since
then so many additional relics have been recovered from the
palafittes that Mr. Perrin's tables can offer no approximation
to accuracy; but, nevertheless, they have a certain value in
showing the relative frequency of the different objects. I have,
therefore, taken the liberty of reconstructing from Mr. Perrin's
data the following list of the objects found in Lake Bourget,
which gives a better general idea of the culture and civilisation
of its lake-dwellers than pages of descriptive details:&mdash;

<span class="smcap">General Remarks on the Palafittes of Lake Bourget.</span>&mdash;Count
Costa de Beauregard, in his excellent article on the
"Habitations Lacustres du Lac du Bourget" (B. 176), states that
the stakes on which these villages were reared were generally of
oak, measuring from six to eight inches in diameter, and that
they were placed at a distance of 100 to 200 yards from the
shore, in a depth of 4 or 5 yards of water. Their lower extremities
almost always bore cutting marks, which could only be made
by metal tools. The great differences as regards their state of
preservation show that the settlements had been occupied for a
long time, necessitating the renewal of the piles at different epochs.</p>

<p>The Count also believes that all the palafittes of Lake Bourget
were constructed during the Bronze Age, in regard to which he thus
writes:&mdash;"Malgré les quelques instruments de silex et les
hachettes de pierre rencontrés dans nos fouilles, il est peu probable,
comme je l'ai déjà dit, que ces bourgades aient été fondées à l'Epoque
de la Pierre. Tout nous porte à croire, au contraire, qu'elles
florissaient à l'Epoque du Bronze, période qui a dû être de fort
longue durée en Savoie, car il a fallu bien des siècles pour accumuler
sur les différents points que nous avons explorés une pareille
quantité d'objets et de débris de toute sorte." (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 23.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relics.</span>&mdash;<i>Weapons.</i>&mdash;The
swords recovered are few, and of one type (<b><a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a></b>,
No. 16). That they are of home manufacture is more than probable from
the finding of portion of a mould of the same class of weapon, now
deposited in the Museum of Chambery. Only a few tips of scabbards
hitherto found (<b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>, No. 20). The daggers
were both tanged and riveted to their handles. Lance-heads (Nos. 1 to 4) are
all socketed, with only one or two exceptions (Nos. 5 and 12), which might
be daggers. They are generally unornamented. Arrow-points are formed
for the most part of triangular plates of bronze, with two or four
holes for fastening them to the stem; but other forms are met with
(<b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>, Nos. 13, 22 to 26, and 32).

<i>Implements.</i>&mdash;Hatchets (<b><a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a></b>, Nos. 9, 10, 11,
and 17) are both winged and socketed, and the latter have their sockets
round, oval, or rectangular. The chisels and gouges are all socketed
(No. 19). Sickles (Nos. 20 and 21) have nearly all a raised button
for fixing the handle (in which respect they differ from those
of Switzerland), and may be classified under a variety of groups
dependent on the degree of curvature and the disposition of their
raised ribs. The knives are socketed, tanged, and with a solid handle
(Nos. 6, 7, 8, 13, and 14); the former being most, and the latter
less, frequent. Razors are of two kinds, with or without a handle
(Nos. 22 and 23). Needles have the eye either at the end or middle.
Awls and a variety of fish-hooks are abundant; but spears or harpoons
are very rare. Rivets, nails, and bits of thin bronze plates, are in
some places abundantly met with. Examples of saws and files have been
found, but in small numbers.</p>

<p><i>Ornaments.</i>&mdash;Pins with large round heads are very rare, as are
also those with wheel heads (the various forms are shown in <b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>,
Nos. 10, 18, 19, 21, 30, and 31). Bracelets (Nos. 16, 17, and 29),
which are numerous, and mostly open, are either solid or hollow
(one is of tin); fibulæ and torques rare; finger-rings are of two
kinds, plain and spiral (No. 7); portions of girdles, buckles,
pendants (No. 5), buttons (No. 33), bronze beads, and small spirals,
are abundant; a clasp is like one from Mörigen (<b><a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a></b>, No. 25).
Tin appears in ingots, in a bracelet, discs, and thin strips for
ornamentation to dishes; also gold in the form of a few portions of
twisted wire or leaf. Several bronze vessels. One charming little
vase (<b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>, No. 14) of cast bronze, figured by
Count Costa de Beauregard, and now in his possession, was found at Grésine along
with a sword (<b><a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a></b>, No. 16), a knife (No. 8), and
about 250 nails supposed to have been used in the manufacture of a shield.
Nos. 1 and 2 of <b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b> represent two remarkable
objects from Grésine, now exhibited in the Museum at Aix-les-Bains. A similar
object, but more worn and minus some of its rings, is in the
Museum at Chambery; and a fourth is in the Museum Lacustre
at the Port (<b><a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a></b>, No. 4). Crescents, spindle-whorls,
fragments of cloth, bits of plaited rushes and basket-work, glass in small
coloured beads, and amber (<b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>, Nos. 27 and 28),
also in small beads, are all fully represented.</p>

<p>The articles represented by Nos. 4, 6, and 12, may be the brass
ornaments on a set of harness; but as to the two curious vessels
of bronze (Nos. 8 and 11), I am unable to assign any use.</p>

<p>The pottery shows great skill in the ceramic art. It is of a
grey, black, or red colour (Nos. 34, 35, 36, and 37). Vessels
combining the three colours, in various geometrical forms, with
linear ornamentation, have been found among them, and others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
with ornamentation reminding one of the impressions of fern-leaves
(<i>Polypodium vulgare</i>).</p>

<p>A few iron spear-heads (<b><a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a></b>) and knives, as
well as Roman tiles and pottery, have also been collected from these palafittes.</p>

<p>The domestic and wild animals, so far as they have been
identified, are similar to those from the Swiss lake-dwellings.</p>

<h3>LAKE ANNECY.</h3>

<p>Since 1856 piles have been discovered in several places in Lake
Annecy, but owing to the depth of water and the accumulation
of mud, their associated relic-beds could not be easily examined.
Up to the present time only four stations have been sufficiently
investigated to enable us to form some idea of their chronological
position with respect to the other remains of lake-dwellings. These
are Stations du Port, De Vieugy, Du Chatillon, and Du Roselet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 22</b>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lake Annecy.</span>
All <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p>The first-named (Station du Port) came to light only in the
beginning of 1884, when the little harbour at the town of
Annecy was being deepened to facilitate the movements of the
pleasure-steamers which ply on the lake during the season. In the
course of these operations the dredging-machines came into contact
with piles, and brought up various kinds of stone implements, etc.,
in the mud, which, unfortunately, were mostly re-deposited in deep
water. The spot where these remains were found lies just at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
extremity of the Swan Island; and after the public works were
completed, the dredger was put at the disposal of the Société
Florimontane, who conducted systematic investigations, both there
and at the stations of Roselet and Vieugy. Previous to this time
all the stations examined had yielded more or fewer bronze objects,
and they were therefore considered to be analogous to
those of Lake Bourget, all of which were founded during the
Bronze Age. The explorations conducted at the Station du
Port upset this view, as from the character of the relics found
on it there could be no doubt that its inhabitants lived chiefly
during the Stone Age, but the station survived to the Bronze Age.
The objects collected from it consist of perforated hammer-axes
of serpentine (<b><a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a></b>, Nos. 8 and 9), polished
hatchets of serpentine, stone spindle-whorls, beautifully-worked daggers and
lance-heads of flint (Nos. 5, 6, and 7), as well as arrow-heads, (one
of shale stone No. 10), saws, scrapers, etc., of the same material.
Only two metal objects, viz. a bronze hair-pin (No. 2), and a bead
(No. 3), probably of copper, like those from Vinelz are recorded;
but these are said to have been on the surface of the relic-bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Station du Roselet</span> was the first
discovered in this lake, but it has yielded only a few relics, among
which are fragments of pottery, some fine spindle-whorls, a hatchet of
serpentine, and a bronze bracelet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chatillon</span> was in a depth of 8 to 13
feet, and among its relics are a socketed knife and a couple of
bracelets (No. 4).</p>

<p class="space-below1">The settlement at Vieugy was discovered in 1868, and
the most important objects from it are a bronze hatchet of the flat type (No. 1),
some stone moulds, and a few rubbers. (B. 315.)</p>

<h3>LAKES OF AIGUEBELLETTE AND THUILLE.</h3>

<p class="space-below1">M. Troyon reported the existence of piles at two
places in the Lake Aiguebellette, and one in Lake Thuille; but of these
I find no further records. (B. 31.)</p>

<h3>LAKE CLAIRVAUX (FRANCE).</h3>

<p>The Lake of Clairvaux is situated on the first rising plateau
of the Jura mountains, not far from the town of Lons-le-Saulnier,
and covers an area of about 200 acres. At its north-west extremity
there is a tongue of land projecting into the lake called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
La Motte-aux-Magnins, which is believed to have been an island
in former times, but is now continuous with a tract of marshy
ground which extends between the Motte and the town of Clairvaux.</p>

<p>It has been recorded that at various times prior to 1870
diverse antiquities were found in the course of drainage operations
in this marshy ground, such as horn implements, stone
axes of flint and jade, boars' tusks, bits of pottery, bronze celts,
a fibula, and an armilla; also Gallo-Roman remains, including a
Gaulish gold coin and Roman coins. In the lake itself there
were no discoveries made, with the exception of a group of five
piles known to fishermen. But none of these discoveries had
ever suggested to any one the idea of a lake-dwelling, the
common and accepted opinion being that they were remains of
Druidical times and customs.</p>

<p>On the 27th of June, 1870, when the water was about
its lowest, Mr. Le Mire happened to be walking on the shore
and accidentally stumbled on the top of a black pile of
oak. His attention being thus directed to such a curious
object, he looked about and detected many others just protruding
from the lake-bottom. He then determined to investigate
the matter, and at once employed some labourers to
make excavations. The place selected was 100 yards to the
west of the Motte-aux-Magnins, and 25 yards to the east of
the canal which forms the outlet of the lake. Trenches were
dug about 1 yard in width and the same in depth (a greater
depth being prevented by the oozing up of water). During
these operations piles were abundantly met with, but no relics
were found, and it was remarked that there was no change
in the stuff thrown up from the trenches, it being the ordinary
whitish deposits similar to what is seen on the present
surface of the strand. The piles were of oak, fir, yew, poplar,
willow, and hazel, and measured from 4 to 6 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>Mr. Le Mire then shifted his operations to the south side
of the Motte-aux-Magnins, and after passing through 6 to 8 inches
of the whitish surface deposits he came upon a blackish peaty
layer containing roots of water-plants and other organic <i>débris</i>,
which turned out to be the veritable relic-bed of the lake-dwellers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he continued the excavations for about three weeks
with a couple of workmen, and in this way an area of about 120
square yards was examined, which he thinks was not more than a
twentieth part of the total site of the lake-dwelling. The piles did
not reach the surface, but they were met with abundantly, no
less than 150 being counted in the space examined. The breaking-out
of the war put a stop to these excavations, and the subsequent
return of the water to its ordinary level prevented their renewal.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Le Mire has published an illustrated report of his
investigations (B. 219), from which these notes are taken,
but the accompanying illustrations (<b><a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a></b>)
are from a selection of objects exhibited in the anthropological section
of the Paris International Exposition of 1889. In this collection I note
that there are a few relics, such as the two bronze objects, to which
Mr. Le Mire does not refer in his report; probably these may
have been found since its publication.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the relics staghorn implements take a prominent place.
Handles and fixers for stone weapons amounted to 49, and the
two here illustrated (of five exhibited in Paris) still retain their
celts (Nos. 6 and 8). There are several perforated horn hammers,
one of which (No. 7) retained portion of its wooden handle when
found; another is a foot long, and the perforation is nearer the
burr of the horn which forms the hammer-end. A tyne 11 inches
long forms the handle to a small stone chisel. Another object
(No. 5) is a <i>unicum</i> of its kind. It is a chisel of horn formed
from the tyne, with the body of the horn forming a neatly-polished handle.</p>

<p>The polished daggers or pointers are also finely made, and
almost remind one of those at Laibach. Twenty-six were exhibited
in Paris, three of which are here represented, including
the largest and smallest (Nos. 9, 13, and 14).</p>

<p>About a dozen triangular or leaf-shaped arrow-points, and
one or two spear-heads of flint. Of the latter, one (No. 2)
is remarkable for its size and elegant workmanship.</p>

<p>Wooden dishes formed out of the solid, all having a round
base, were collected to the number of 15, and some large globular
pieces of wood were supposed to be the primary stage of their
manufacture. One dish figured by Le Mire is here reproduced,
and shows a neat handle (No. 15). There were also wooden
mallets perforated for a handle. Three bits of a bow, one showing
the tip with a notch for the string. An axle-tree for a waggon
Le Mire considers interesting, as showing a knowledge and use
of traction by wheels.</p>

<p>Besides a few stone celts and chisels, most of which were still
in their horn handles, there were a few flint knives (No. 1), three
sharpening stones, two curious and novel objects of polished
stone, one of which is illustrated (No. 10).</p>

<p>The pottery includes 140 fragments of dishes, showing various
forms of handles and linear ornamentation.</p>

<p>Of bronze there are just two objects, a small awl or chisel and
a much-worn dagger (Nos. 11 and 12).</p>

<p>Animal bones collected to the amount of 150 kilogrammes
were not reported on by a skilled person; but, according to
Le Mire, they belonged chiefly to the ox, stag, boar and pig;
among them was a fine specimen of a bear's skull. Among
other organic remains were a few grains of wheat and acorns.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h3>MARSH DWELLING IN THE TOWN OF BORDEAUX.</h3>

<p>In 1867 Mr. Delfortrie (B. 136) published a notice of prehistoric
antiquities of the Neolithic Age found in the course of excavations
for the improvement of the town of Bordeaux, which point to the
existence of some kind of marsh dwelling in the very centre of the
town. Attention was first directed to the matter by the quantity of
bones thrown up from the lower part of the excavations, among which
Delfortrie detected some worked ones, and associated with them were
various stone and flint implements.</p>

<p>In regard to the osseous remains, he observes that the lower
jaws of ruminants, which were relatively in great abundance,
had their incisor teeth purposely removed, but the molars were
retained. On the other hand, the upper jaws were entirely
absent or broken, like all other marrow bones.</p>

<p class="space-below1">At three different points forming an almost
equilateral triangle of 200 mètres the side, he procured sections of
these street cuttings, in all of which the succession of strata and
relics indicated similar conditions. At one point he gives the
following details of a section:&mdash;</p>

<p class="space-above1">The bones represented the following
animals:&mdash;Great ox, smaller ox, stag, pig, wild boar, horse (a
small kind), goat, sheep, and dog. Mr. Delfortrie thinks the bones of
the horse show that the animal was not domesticated. No piles were
discovered except in the Gallo-Roman period. The following shells
were found in the marine bed C.:&mdash;Ostrea edulis, Pecten maximus,
Mytilus edulis, Venus decussata, Cardium edule, Mactrea solida, Turbo
neritoides, and Trochus cinerarius.</p>

<p>The relics were found chiefly in bed E., among the ashes, a
few being from the sandy peat above it. These consist of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
pointers, needles, polishers, spatulæ, arrow-points, and an implement
of bone called a whistle; flint saws, a polished celt also of
flint, three small polished stone celts of serpentine or quartzite,
and about a dozen flint knives.</p>

<p>The opinion of the narrator is that there was here a marsh
dwelling of the nature of the Kökkenmödings of Denmark
which in point of time preceded the Swiss lake-dwellings, but
was posterior to the Reindeer Period of Central France.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the character and finish of the relics furnish
no grounds for supposing that this habitation was prior to the
early Swiss lake-dwellings; nor are we warranted, from such
limited explorations as could be made in the streets of a town,
to exclude the more probable idea that this was an ordinary
palafitte, notwithstanding that piles were not observed.

<h2>Second Lecture.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">SETTLEMENTS IN EASTERN SWITZERLAND, THE DANUBIAN VALLEY, AND CARNIOLA.</span></h2>

<p>The remains of lake-dwellings which I have hitherto described
were, with one or two exceptions, situated on the borders of
large lakes, and the industrial remains recovered from them were
found more or less buried in the lake sediment. But these are not
the invariable circumstances in which such antiquities are met
with, as has already been noticed in the case of Wauwyl; but
their differentiating points I did not then discuss, reserving them
for this special occasion.</p>

<p>Every careful observer of natural phenomena must have
noticed how, under certain well-defined conditions, the superficial
areas of lakes are becoming gradually encroached upon, not only
by the accumulation of <i>débris</i> carried into them by streams
and rain-wash, but by the growth of peat on their margins. This
latter process occurs more frequently in the smaller lakes&mdash;so
much so that some of them have now almost entirely disappeared
owing to the complete filling up of their basins. Though the
growth of peat is slow, and almost imperceptible to individual
observers, whose lifetime is generally too short to mark its progressive
character, it has proved a most formidable antagonist to
lake settlements by destroying their lacustrine character, and
thus compelling their inhabitants to abandon them altogether.
The peat has, in some instances, actually engulfed entire villages,
with the accumulated <i>débris</i> of their industrial equipments, thus
hermetically sealing up everything in one of the best antidotes
to natural decay. Cities and mighty empires have risen, flourished,
and disappeared, without transmitting to future ages a single record
of their existence, like flowers born to blush unseen. Such, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
might have been the fate of many of these pile-villages, notwithstanding
the favourable conditions in which their ruins have
been sealed up, had it not been for the mere accident of peat cutting,
which has disclosed so many of their buried treasures.
These remarks are peculiarly applicable to the celebrated settlement
at Robenhausen, with which I begin to-day's lecture.</p>

<h3>LAKE OF PFÄFFIKON.</h3>

<p>The small lake of Pfäffikon, which lies to the east of Lake Zürich,
contained two settlements, viz. Robenhausen and Irgenhausen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robenhausen.</span>&mdash;This well-known
station, which has furnished specimens of lake-dwelling remains
to most of the European museums, is situated near the middle of
an extensive tract of pasture-land on the south side of the lake.
Although its site is now several hundred yards from the lake, there
can be no doubt that, originally, it was completely surrounded by
water; the nearest land, that on the west, being some 2,000 yards
distant. On the east side the old lake-shore is 3,000 yards distant,
and towards this, notwithstanding its greater distance, there extended
a gangway, the remains of which can still be traced. Underneath the
grass there is a thick deposit of peat, which has been utilised as
fuel according to the needs of the surrounding community; and a
mere glance at the locality shows that the whole expanse is but an
encroachment of the peat on what was formerly part of the lake. The
meadow belongs to peasant proprietors, among whom it is parcelled into
small plots. During the winter of 1857-8 Mr. Jacob Messikommer, the
owner of one of these plots, discovered the remains of a pile-dwelling
on his portion, and to its investigation he has ever since devoted
himself. His efforts were greatly encouraged by Dr. Keller and other
members of the Antiquarian Society at Zürich, to whose museum many of
the principal relics have been sent. A few years after its discovery,
the project of deepening and widening the outlet, which, as it so
happened, passed through the lake-dwelling, afforded a splendid
opportunity to archæologists for investigating its antiquarian
remains. Messikommer was appointed superintendent of the
proposed excavations. Since then he has on several occasions
when the waters were low, as in the years 1864, 1865, 1870, 1875,
1882, 1884, and 1886, made more or less extensive diggings in
different parts of the settlement for the purpose of clearing up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
obscure or disputed points. Altogether he has made good use of
his advantages, and to his intelligent and watchful care we are
indebted for a careful record of the relics, as well as a series of
shrewd observations bearing on the character and duration of this
settlement, which has made it one of the most instructive in the
whole range of lacustrine research.</p>

<p>The space occupied by the settlement formed an irregular
quadrangle, little short of three acres in extent. The piles were
made from the round or split stems of trees&mdash;oak, beech, and
pine being the prevailing kinds. On the supposition that they were
placed at uniform distances throughout, Messikommer calculates
from the data supplied by the Aabach Canal, which involved an
area of about 4,000 square feet, that 100,000 piles were required
for the construction of the entire lake-village.</p>

<p>In order to get at the relics, one has to dig through 5 or
6 feet of peat, in which no relics are found, with the exception of
the piles, the tops of which nearly reach to the surface. Such
pits are soon filled with water, as all the relic-beds are below the
level of the lake.</p>

<p>As the excavations progressed, Messikommer made the important
observation that the piles could be distinguished into three
sets, corresponding with so many relic-beds.</p>

<p>The first set of piles penetrated into the shell marl some
10 or 11 feet below the present surface; and immediately over
this marl there was a bed of greasy peat only 4 or 5 inches thick
containing a few relics. Then followed a bed of charcoal with
carbonised wheat, barley, cloth, etc., the result, according to our
investigator, of a general conflagration which destroyed the
entire settlement. After this catastrophe a new superstructure was
reared, the piles of which were so closely set that, on an average
three or four could be counted in each square foot. This new
village appears to have flourished for a long time, as its duration
is represented by a peaty deposit nearly 3 feet thick containing a
variety of relics, as bones, pottery, portions of clay flooring, etc.
Then followed a second bed of burnt materials, as corn, fruits,
bread, and the usual industrial implements of stone&mdash;all of which
point to a second conflagration. But, apparently undiscouraged,
the lake-dwellers again undertook the task of reconstructing
their peculiar dwellings, and Messikommer distinguishes this
third series of piles by their not penetrating so deeply as those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
of the previous habitations. While the piles of the earlier
dwellings penetrated into the shell marl, those of the third
structure fell short of the former by 2&frac12; feet and terminated in
the intervening accumulated <i>débris</i>. On the other hand, however,
their tops reached higher in the peat, coming nearly to the
present surface. Further, he observed that it was only in the
third settlement that the piles were split, those of the two former
being round and much more decayed. Also, corresponding to
its duration, there was a deposit of peat 3 feet in depth containing
various relics, but no evidence of a conflagration, and above this
point the peat was entirely destitute of the remains of human
industry. It would thus appear that the lake-dwellers voluntarily
abandoned their village, either on account of the accumulation
of peat or because, in the exigencies of civilisation, they found
more congenial conditions of habitation elsewhere.</p>

<p>During the excavations in the Aabach canal the above facts
were amply demonstrated, as, indeed, they can be at the present
time by any one who chooses to make the necessary excavations,
permission for which the proprietor freely gives.</p>

<p>From the peculiar grouping and distribution of the relics over
certain areas Mr. Messikommer came to the conclusion that while
each cottage had its special appliances, as a hearth, a millstone,
sharpening stones, and weaving materials, there were other relics
specially localised. Thus there were large quantities of corn in
one place, dried fruits in another, flax in a third, etc. He also
learned to recognise from the kind of litter used, and the
droppings of the animals, where the stalls for cattle, sheep, and
goats were located; which, according to him, were in the intervals
between the cottages. Bones, scales of fish, dried fruits, water-chestnuts,
beech and hazel-nuts, acorns, and other remains of
food, were very abundantly met with. The following are some
of the more interesting relics from this vast deposit of the industrial
remains of many ages:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wooden Objects.</i>&mdash;A bow of yew, five feet long, still
retaining the notch at both ends for the string; another specimen
measures only 3&frac12; feet in length. A large tub-like dish, nearly
16 inches in diameter, and a variety of ladles. A yoke for cattle,
made of a hazel branch. A large door of wood, so arranged as to turn
on a pivot, and measuring 4 feet 9 inches by 2&frac12; feet wide, and
1&frac12; inch thick; a canoe 12 feet long, 2&frac12; feet wide, and 5
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
inches deep; a large assortment of handles, knives (<b><a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a></b>,
No. 15), clubs (No. 26), dishes, suspension hooks, etc.</p>

<p><i>Horn and Bone.</i>&mdash;Haftings for stone axes and chisels (Nos.
8 and 9), daggers, chisels, perforated axe-hammers (No. 12), arrow-points
(No. 2), agricultural implements, small cup (No. 7), etc.</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Axes of nephrite are scarce, but they are abundant
of the ordinary materials (No. 23)&mdash;some are perforated; flint
saws in their handles, hammer-stones (No. 10), pendants (No. 3), a
stone disc polished and perforated in the centre with a round hole
(No. 13), arrow-points and scrapers of flint (No. 1), two small
objects of redstone perforated with a series of holes (Nos. 5 and 6).</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Earthenware cups, spoons, and various kinds of
vessels (Nos. 14, 16, 17, and 18). Particularly noteworthy is one with a
conical base requiring a ring-support (No. 18). Several coarse
crucibles with handles (No. 22). When the first of these objects
was discovered, it was supposed to be a large spoon, but latterly
traces of copper were found in the pores of one, and thus their
true nature was recognised. These crucibles were found a few
years after the discovery of the lake-dwelling, and although
Messikommer was constantly on the look-out for metal objects it
was not till 1882 that his search was rewarded. This was a small
copper celt of the flat type (No. 4), but as it was in stuff thrown
out of the trenches for some time, it was impossible to say to which
settlement it belonged. (B. 383, p. 324.) In 1884 Messikommer
announced that a crucible which had evidently been used was
found in the stratum of <i>débris</i> corresponding with the second
settlement at Robenhausen.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>On the 4th of October, 1887 (B. 454), Mr. H. Messikommer, while
making excavations in an undisturbed part of this lake-dwelling,
found near the surface of the peat, and on a level with the tops of
the piles, another hatchet of the flat type made of bronze (No. 11).
It is clear from these respective finds that the Robenhausen lake-dwelling
came to an end before bronze came into general use.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
<i>Weaving Materials.</i>&mdash;A great many specimens of flax, yarn ropes,
balls of thread, bits of ribbon, and variously-woven cloths, fishing
and hair nets,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
plaited borders, fringes, and mats (<b><a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a></b>).
Loom-weights (<b><a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a></b>, Nos. 20 and 21) and clay pirns
were also met with, but, singularly enough, hardly any spindle-whorls. It is
not very clear in what position these recorded relics have been found; but in
1882, when the water happened to be very low, the lowest relic-bed
was carefully searched, and similar remains were found in it. In
consequence of these finds, Messikommer announced, in 1882 (B.
383a, p. 379), that he was convinced that all manner of weaving
was thoroughly known at the very commencement of the Robenhausen
lake-dwelling.</p>

<p>The third settlement has yielded very little cloth or thread,
probably owing to the fact that no conflagration took place, by the
charring of which such remains are preserved from decomposition.
On the other hand, jade implements, among which is an arrow-head
of nephrite, and some 60 seeds, and fruits, have been collected.
Among the latter the water-chestnut (<i>Trapa natans</i>) may
be especially noted, as it no longer grows in the locality. (B. 462.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irgenhausen.</span>&mdash;Only one other
settlement has been recognised as a true lake-dwelling in this
lake-basin, viz. Irgenhausen, situated about half an hour's walk to
the east of Robenhausen. The station ran parallel to the shore for
a distance of about 300 feet, with a breadth of only 30 feet. The
relics found on it are similar in character to those from Robenhausen,
the most remarkable of which are specimens of embroidered cloth
and checked muslins. (B. 126, Pl. xvi. Fig. 2 and 2a.) Messikommer
believes that only one row of cottages occupied this site. Almost the
whole site of this lake-dwelling has disappeared into the depths
since 1881, and can no longer be found.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Only a yawning deep (<i>eine gähnende Tiefe</i>) is now to be seen where
formerly stood the remains of the Pfahlbau. This phenomenon is,
however, not singular in the Swiss lakes, as evidence of which we have
the recent catastrophe in Lake Zug, which demolished not only the site
of a prehistoric lake-dwelling, but also a large part of the town of Zug.

Close to the water's edge on the south shore, and about ten
minutes' walk directly north of Robenhausen, there is an artificial
mound called Himmereich, which formerly was supposed
to be the site of a pile-dwelling. It is constructed of small
and large stones, among which flint saws, arrow-points, and
pottery of the lake-dwelling type, were found associated with
Roman tiles and pottery (<i>terra sigillata</i>). There were, however,
no piles or any evidence of structural dwellings, and the opinion
now generally held in regard to it is that it was a pre-Roman
Refugium, which subsequently fell into the hands of the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Remains of a Roman station are also close to Irgenhausen,
which might have something to do with the Himmereich mound. (B. 462.)</p>

<p class="space-below1">The records of the numerous discoveries made at
Robenhausen from time to time, according to the favourableness of
the weather, are, like the relics themselves, widely scattered. In
addition to the reports of Keller and J. Messikommer (B. 22,
34, 40, 61, 126, 336, and 462) in the proceedings of the Society
of Antiquaries of Zürich, we have a number of further notices
in various journals, such as <i>Anzeiger</i>, <i>Antiqua</i>, <i>Das Ausland</i>,
etc. (B. 143a and 143b, 154, 256, 383, 385a and 385b, 402, 403,
406c and 406d, 434c, 449b, 454b, etc.), from which more or less
important information is to be gleaned.</p>

<h3>EGELSEE, NEAR FRAUENFIELD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Niederwyl.</span>&mdash;The settlement of
Niederwyl was situated in a small basin covering only about 60 acres,
which, though now entirely overgrown with peat, must have been
formerly a lake, as its ancient name Egelsee implies. Immediately
to the south there is an open valley, from which it is separated by
a narrow ridge of land, through which its proprietors made a deep
excavation for its better drainage, thereby facilitating the removal
of the peat. While the peasants were thus occupied, they came upon a
portion of the basin near its centre, where the peat began to thin
out; and as they advanced, it turned out that there was something like
a mound entirely submerged in the peat, and composed of clay, wooden
beams, stones, charcoal, and all sorts of rubbish. On the centre of
this mound the depth of peat was only 2 or 3 feet, while all around
it amounted to 8 or 10 feet. This curious elevation was simply passed
over by the workmen after removing its covering of peat; and so it
remained exposed, till one day the Reverend Mr. Pupikofer happened to
pass along the moor, when he recognised its archæological importance.
This was in 1862, and immediately the Historical Society of Thurgau
arranged to have the matter investigated; and Mr. Jacob Messikommer,
whose experience of the lake-dwelling at Robenhausen had made him an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
authority on such matters, was asked to conduct the necessary
researches. Upon making sections through the exposed part of this
mound, he found an artificial sub-structure of faggot-sticks, laid
transversely, and mixed with upright piles which penetrated to the
original lake-bottom. It was fortunate, however, that the whole
of the mound had not been bared of peat, and Messikommer wisely
selected an undisturbed portion for his subsequent excavations. The
following quotation from his report will convey a better idea of these
structures than any abstract I could make:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I began the excavation with a few workmen on the
18th of June, I was surprised to find, under a pavement of clay
and gravel, from 2 to 4 inches thick, and from the top of which
3 feet of peat had been removed, a structure of faggot-sticks,
regularly laid and perfectly solid; and as the wood was exceedingly
soft, we had to use every care in uncovering as large a
portion of it as we could. We first bared a space, which was
in perfect condition, 20 feet long, 6 feet wide at the ends, and
10 feet wide in the middle. The upper platform was of split
timber or boards of oak, laid down with great care, and it
rested on round timber, or faggot-sticks, from 3 to 4 inches in
diameter, which were surrounded with piles. The back part of
the space was covered with charcoal, and was somewhat charred;
there were also found tolerably large stones (hearth-stones) in
their original position. A most striking fact was that the lowest
part of the side wall was still standing; it consisted of a kind
of shutter pushed in between the upright piles surrounding the
space. On this I had other portions uncovered, and everywhere
met with the same construction, only differing in having the
platform or floor made of faggot-sticks instead of boards. Here
and there the floor had sunk considerably, often one or one inch
and a half in six inches.</p>

<p>"This place was then left to be examined by the members
of the associations of Thurgau and Zürich, and excavations were
made in another place to examine the sub-structure. The result
proved no less interesting; for 1 foot deep, under the first
platform, we came upon a second; a foot deeper we found a
third; then a fourth, and so on; so that the arrangement is
similar to that of Wauwyl. The huts were placed on masses of
wood, consisting of five or six platforms, one above the other,
the spaces between which were filled in with brushwood and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
branches of trees, chiefly alder, rushes, gravel, and clay. We
were surprised to meet with bones, cones of earthenware, and a
great wooden mallet between the platforms; we also found
woven cloth under the fifth platform, and charcoal close to the
bed of the lake. From this I conclude that the platforms were
not made at the same time, but at intervals, one after the
other; or that they had been repaired, a portion at a time, as
we found single charred stems under fresh wood." (B. 119,
2nd ed., p. 77.)</p>

<p>In another section Messikommer observed a slight variation
in the fascine structures above described, which he thus explains:
"What I have called the lattice or trellis work consisted of thin
stems of trees, which were not laid close together, but at intervals
of from one to two inches apart; the uppermost stems rested
on others lying under them at right angles, and these again on
others parallel with those on the upper layer. The spaces
between the timbers were filled in with charcoal and burnt clay."</p>

<p>Each structure seemed to have been adapted for one cottage,
as between them there were narrow spaces which had got filled
up with <i>débris</i>, and contained relics such as broken stone
hatchets, carbonised cloth and fruits, etc.</p>

<p>"We cannot imagine," continues Messikommer, "that this settlement
was destroyed by fire, for although we occasionally met with burnt
beams, not a single trace of conflagration was to be seen in the
upright piles, which projected as much as 2&frac12; feet above the
floor&mdash;nay, even in most of them the bark was still in good
preservation.</p>

<p>"The products of the potters art were in general very coarse,
and yet we found a few fragments which had been ornamented,
and also parts of the rims of vessels made with washed or
purified clay, and without quartz grains. Fragments of vessels
also were found neatly polished, blackened, and with handles of
a convenient form. No smaller implements were met with,
such as pins, little chisels, etc. It is very singular that so
few bones were found; the cow, stag, and the pig were the only
animals the remains of which were discovered here.</p>

<p>"At the bottom of some broken earthenware vessels there still
remained grains of wheat and barley and hazel-nuts. Doubtless all the
food, whether animal or vegetable, was kept in large or small vessels of earthenware."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Subsequently, on two occasions, Messikommer was asked by
archæological societies to give a practical exposition of
this interesting <i>Packwerkbau</i> for the edification of their
members&mdash;once in 1872, when the meeting of the Swiss Natural
History Society was held at Frauenfield; and again in 1877, when the
German Anthropological Association met at Constance. (B. 406c.)</p>

<p>On all these occasions Messikommer paid particular attention
to the size and kind of cottages the lake-dwellers possessed. In
1862, from the stumps of piles protruding through a portion of
undisturbed flooring, he estimated the size of the habitable area for
each cottage at 24 feet long by 18 feet broad. On these floorings
were seen the remains of food and industry, just as fresh as if
the people had recently left the place. ("Die Mühle mit Gerste
und Weizen daneben, als wäre sie erst gestern noch bewohnt
gewesen.") He believes that each cottage possessed not only its
own domestic utensils but also its weaving and corn-grinding machines, etc.</p>

<p>The area occupied by the entire settlement was 20,000 square
feet, and the nearest shore, when the basin was a lake, would be
30 or 40 yards distant.</p>

<p>The industrial remains collected from time to time at
Niederwyl consist of:&mdash;Wheat, barley, flax, cakes of bread,
wooden implements, clay weights (<b><a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a></b>, No. 3),
stone hatchets (Nos. 7 and 8), flint saws (No. 1) and scrapers; some well-made
dishes (Nos. 4, 5 and 6), one a remarkable jug (No. 6) with
handle; another, of black earthenware, had been mended with
asphalt. A strip of birch-bark (now in the Museum at Zürich)
had been neatly sewn (No. 10). In the same Museum there is
a stone (perforated) axe-hammer head which vies in elegance of
workmanship with any from Scandinavia (No. 9).</p>

<p>Recently Messikommer has come to the conclusion that the
<i>Packwerkbau</i> at Niederwyl existed during the early Bronze
Age, as he found a piece of oak wood having cuts which could
not have been made by a stone implement. From various
considerations of the more recent facts brought to light in the
course of his frequent excavations here and at Robenhausen he
enunciates the opinion that wherever split oak beams or piles
are found we may with certainty conclude that the settlement
belongs to the early metal age. ("Man darf mit Bestimmtheit
annehmen, dass alle jene Niederlassungen, in welchen gespaltenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Eichenholz in grösserer Menge zum Vorschein kommt, auch
das Metall in einfacher [Kupfer] oder zusammengesetzter Form
[Bronze] gekannt haben.") (B. 454c, p. 2.)</p>

<p><i>Second Station.</i>&mdash;Adjacent to the Egelsee basin, and separated
from it only by about a dozen paces, is another small peat-basin
known as the Riedsee, in which were recently found the remains
of a true pile-dwelling. Here for some time fragments of pottery,
stone hatchets, horns and bones of various animals, were met with
in the peat; but in August, 1884, Messikommer discovered the
actual piles associated with the usual objects of a Stone Age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
dwelling. The area of this Pfahlbau was small, measuring only
13 yards by 10. Its site lay near the margin of the peat, and
the antiquities were met with 1 foot under the surface. Among
these were a small earthenware dish or cover ornamented with
four prominences and a few rows of punctured dots (No. 2),
several wooden dishes in all stages of manufacture, entire
handles of stone hatchets, worked horn, etc. A crucible similar
to those from Robenhausen was also found near the same place.</p>

<p>Among the osseous remains are portions of a skull of the
urus with both horn-cores attached. The other animals represented
are the bison, stag, ox, pig, goat, etc. (B. 420d.)</p>

<h3>GREIFENSEE.</h3>

<p>During the winter of 1865-6, when the water was low,
Messikommer recognised the site of a pile-dwelling in the
Greifensee, near Riedikon, but it has proved of little importance,
as only a few objects&mdash;some flints and stone celts, fragments of
pottery, shells of hazel-nuts, and some grains of barley&mdash;were
found. Its site was covered with broken stones, and being about
100 feet from the shore, in a depth of 3 or 4 feet even when the
water was low, it was difficult to make a satisfactory examination.
(B. 126, p. 308.)</p>

<p>Traces of a second station are said to have been observed
between Riedikon and the village of Greifensee, near where the
Aabach enters the lake. (B. 462.)</p>

<h3>HEIMENLACHEN.</h3>

<p>Near the village of Heimenlachen, in the Canton of Thurgau,
there is a peat-moor covering about 15 acres, in which the peasants
while cutting peat were occasionally turning up objects of human
industry deeply buried, but they have been either dispersed among
the curious or thrown away. A large skull of an ox, supposed to
be that of a urus, lay for years exposed among a heap of rubbish,
but when subsequently searched for, it could not be found. Among
these relics were celts of nephrite, stone hammers, various articles
of bone and horn, and some fragments of pottery and basket-work.
Mr. Burkhard Raeber, of Weinfelden, drew attention to these
current reports, and made some excavations in the moor, in the
course of which he discovered numerous piles and some transverse
beams which he considered to have belonged to a platform.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Another site in the same moor was discovered in 1875, which
yielded similar evidence of a pile-dwelling. The woodwork was
not encountered till 4 feet of peat had been removed. Mr. Raeber
calculates that the settlement was from 80 to 100 yards in length.
(B. 182a, 199, and 336.)</p>

<h3>KRÄHENRIED, NEAR KALTENBRUNNEN IN THURGAU.</h3>

<p>Mr. Raeber found evidence of the existence of a pile settlement
in a peat bog at Krähenried. Here the relic-bed was 5 or 6
feet deep, and contained remains of piles, charcoal, hazel-nuts,
fragments of pottery, and a well-made celt of serpentine. The
ornamentation on the pottery consisted in many cases of regular
rows of dots impressed on a fine quality of paste with a smooth
surface. The peat-cutters assured Mr. Raeber that similar objects
had been frequently found by them, but, considering them of no
value, they were thrown away. (B. 288.)</p>

<h3>LAKE OF NUSSBAUMEN.</h3>

<p>In an open valley between Stein and Frauenfield there is a
chain of three small lakes, the upper of which goes by the
name of Nussbaumen. Here there is an artificial island, on which
Mr. Morlot had observed piles and other indications of a lake-dwelling,
but the matter has never been thoroughly investigated.
According to Morlot, this island measures 110 feet by 60 feet,
is surrounded by piles, and has a similar appearance to that in
the little lake at Inkwyl. (B. 31, p. 84.)</p>

<h3>LAKE OF CONSTANCE.</h3>

<p>The district around the Lake of Constance appears to have
had great attractions for the early lake-settlers. This predilection
was no doubt due to the exceptionably favourable conditions
which the lake afforded for the construction of their pile-villages,
viz. a gently-sloping lake-bottom, with a wide tract of grazing
or agricultural land beyond. In every sheltered bay around
the Untersee, Ueberlingersee, and lower parts of the Bodensee,
traces of these settlements have been found; but owing to the
difficulties and expense of investigation they have not yet yielded
their due quota of relics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wangen.</span>&mdash;The first discovered was
that at Wangen. It is recorded that Mr. Caspar Löhle, after reading
Kellers first report <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125"
id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> of the Pfahlbauten, recollected
having seen on the shore near his own house similar antiquities to
those figured from Ober-Meilen. He then commenced, in the autumn of
1856, to collect them; and when the water was low he made excavations,
which by degrees rewarded him with some remarkable remains of human
industry. The station was in a small bay to the east of the village,
in front of a considerable extent of flat land which intervened
between it and the sunny slopes beyond. This bay, owing to its
sheltered position, was subject to an unusual deposition of lake
sediment, so that in the course of time the <i>débris</i> of the settlement
became covered over with 3 or 4 feet of mud and gravel. As this
deposition went on, from year to year, the bed of the lake became
gradually raised, and the water was displaced, so that at certain
seasons, when the water in the lake was very low, the relic-bed of the
settlement could be investigated by digging on dry land.</p>

<p>Mr. Löhle, in the course of his extensive excavations, ascertained
that the settlement extended in the form of a parallelogram
some 700 paces in length and 120 in breadth. The piles were
made of round or split stems of various kinds of wood, as oak,
beech, elm, birch, ash, fir, elder, maple, and two species of willow.
They were thickly placed, sometimes three or four together, and
Mr. Löhle calculates that in the entire settlement 40,000 or
50,000 must have been used. The relics collected were very
numerous, but they are widely dispersed. The best public collections
that I have seen are in the Museums at Zürich, Constance,
and Sigmaringen. The following notes and accompanying illustrations
(<b><a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a></b>) will give a fair idea of their character.</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Celts, hammer-stones, grain-rubbers, etc., were in
hundreds, and in all stages of manufacture, but the great majority
were badly made. Perforated tools were comparatively rare
(Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 20). Flint saws hafted in wood (No. 15), and
flint arrow-heads and lance-heads, were in tolerable abundance
(Nos. 1, 2, and 3). The celts and chisels were made from the
ordinary water-worn materials found in the neighbourhood
(Nos. 6 and 10), and only a few small specimens were of nephrite
and jadeite. Very few had horn fasteners, and the prevalent
method of using these implements was to insert the celt into
a cleft in a branch with a long handle and a crook at the other
end. Slabs for grinding and polishing these celts, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
others with marks of fire, and supposed to have been used as
hearths, were also frequently met with.</p>

Nos. 5, and 17 to 19 = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>,
and the rest = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Bone and Horn.</i>&mdash;Pointers, daggers, awls, small chisels,
and arrow-points were found in large numbers. Some of the bone
arrow-heads had still the asphalt adhering to them by which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
were fastened to the stems. Also flax-hecklers (No. 4), and a
variety of fish-hooks (Nos. 11 and 16).</p>

<p><i>Clay.</i>&mdash;The fragments of pottery indicated dishes of a plain
shape, generally cylindrical, and rarely ornamented, but smeared over
with a black sooty substance (Nos. 17, 18, and 19). Spindle-whorls
of burnt clay (Nos. 12 and 13), and large clay balls, perforated,
probably loom-weights.</p>

<p><i>Wood.</i>&mdash;A plank of oak 7 or 8 feet long and 1&frac12; foot
wide is supposed to have been a working bench. Another board, also of
oak, was like a round table, and measured 2&frac12; feet in diameter
and 2&frac12; inches thick.</p>

<p><i>Organic Remains.</i>&mdash;The most remarkable feature, however,
of the settlement at Wangen was the quantity of charred corn dug up
from its <i>débris</i>. Mr. Löhle believes that altogether, and at various
times, he has collected as much as 100 bushels. Sometimes he found
the entire ears, at other times the grain only; but always in a
charred condition. The two-rowed barley and two kinds of wheat could
be readily identified. Cakes of bread showing roughly-crushed grain,
wild apples and pears&mdash;all, of course, in a charred condition,
otherwise they would not have been preserved from decomposition. In
some places there were large quantities of the husks of pine-cones,
apple-cores, beech and hazel-nuts, as well as the seeds of raspberries
and brambles. From the quantity of apple-cores found in one place it
has been suggested that the lake-dwellers made some kind of liquor
of fruits. Flax in all stages of manufacture, from the crude bundles
of stems with the seed-vessels still attached, to the yarn, and a
variety of beautifully-woven cloth. Quantities of moss, rushes, bark
of trees, straw, etc., were also collected. These antiquities were not
promiscuously all over the area of the settlement, but each group had
a well-defined area for itself, from which Mr. Löhle inferred that the
different trades were kept apart.</p>

<p>Bones were not numerous, but among them the following animals are
represented:&mdash;Urus, aurochs, stag, roe, wild boar, wolf, fox, and dog.</p>

<p>In one part of the settlement Mr. Löhle observed some piles that
had become bent and twisted like the letter <b>S</b>, evidently from
superincumbent pressure; and in these places some additional piles had
been inserted by way of support.</p>

<p>No metal objects were found, nor any support-rings of clay, nor
discoidal stones. (B. 22, 34, 35, and 40.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oberstaad.</span>&mdash;Starting from Wangen,
we shall now make a circuit of the Untersee, briefly noting its
various stations as we move along. The number now amounts to upwards
of 20, and their respective positions can be ascertained from the
accompanying Sketch Map (<a href="#Map_7">page 129</a>). Below Wangen, the first
we come to is in the bay between Oberstaad and Kattenhorn. From its widely
scattered remains this station appears to have extended over a large
area; but its piles are sparingly seen, and its site has been little
investigated. The relics found are a few stone celts and pottery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hof bei Stein.</span>&mdash;A little below
the bridge which crosses the outlet of the Rhine at Stein there is
a shallow part of the river known as "Auf dem Hof," which on rare
occasions, when the water is low, becomes exposed. This was the case
on two occasions within the memory of persons now living, viz. in
1858 and 1883. On the last of these dates Mr. B. Schenk, naturalist,
of Stein, discovered that it contained the remains of a pile-dwelling
buried in the mud. The piles in this structure were strong and
firmly fixed, and among them were some transverse beams, and others
slantingly placed, as if to protect the structure against the stream.
Notwithstanding the difficulty of working here, Mr. Schenk collected
a large number of the industrial remains of its inhabitants, such
as flint implements, about 150 stone axes (three of which were of
nephrite), and a perforated stone disc like a large spindle-whorl,
measuring 2&frac34; inches in diameter, and 1&frac12; inches thick.
Perforated stone axes were rare, but some of them are of interest,
especially a portion of one made of basalt. There were also worked
objects of horn and bone, remains of linen cloth, thread, and a woven
fabric made of bast. Noteworthy among bone objects is the scapula of
a deer perforated with a round hole, and having its central ridge
rubbed off, so as to make it into a polishing implement. An urn-shaped
vessel 12 inches high is preserved in the Zürich Museum. A few metal
objects are also recorded, viz. a small copper celt 2&frac34; inches
long, also a bronze ring and a bronze hatchet. Bones representing the
ox, pig, stag, roe, bear, and beaver. (B. 462; <i>Antiqua</i>, 1883, p. 68.)

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Das Weerd.</span>&mdash;The existence of the
remains of a lake-dwelling at the east end of the Insel Weerd has
been known for a long time. The site is close to where a Roman bridge
extended from Eschenz to Arach; but the piles are somewhat scattered,
and embrace both sides of the river. In 1882 Mr. Schenk succeeded in
finding its relic-bed, which he describes as composed of two distinct
layers&mdash;the upper one being of a dark colour probably the result
of the conflagration which destroyed the settlement; and a lower of
a yellowish colour, containing much organic <i>débris</i>. About 4 cubic
mètres of this <i>Kulturgeschicht</i> was examined, and among the relics
collected were three human skulls, one of which is perfect, but the
others were in bits; a knife, a hair-pin, and some rings of bronze; a
copper celt (B. 420b, p. 174); polished stone celts, one of which was
made of jadeite. In addition to these, there were various objects of
Roman times collected on or in the vicinity of this station, including
a tile with an inscription, a bronze statue, Roman coins, etc. In
the Rosgarten Museum there is a bronze sword, said to be from this
station; also a quern stone 21 inches in diameter, with a central hole
3 inches in diameter. But it is not probable that either of these
objects really belonged to the lake-dwellers. The bronze knife, three
pins, and some perforated stone implements (<b><a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a></b>,
Nos. 4 to 7, and 10), are also in this museum, and labelled "Insel Weerd."
The human skull has been reported on by Professor Kollmann, who shows it
to be dolichocephalic. (<i>Antiqua</i>, 1883, p. 69; and 1884, p. 174;
<i>Das Ausland</i>, 1885, p. 219; B. 462.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mammern.</span>&mdash;In the bay above Mammern,
at a place called Neuenburgerhorn, there is an extensive area
containing very decayed piles. It was investigated by Messikommer in
1861 on behalf of the Historical Society of Thurgau. (B. 41.) The
piles commenced about 160 feet from the shore, and extended some 400
feet along, covering an area of 40,000 square feet. The antiquities
were all found on the surface, and consisted of hundreds of stone
celts, flint implements, pottery, and bones. No small bone tools, nor
any trace of the lighter industrial remains or food material, were
met with, nor was there a relic-bed underneath. Hence Messikommer
concluded that the finer contents of the relic-bed had been washed
away by the current of water, which, it seems, is pretty strong at
this place. (B. 40, p. 26.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feldbach</span> and <span
class="smcap">Steckborn</span>.&mdash;A station called "Pfahlbau
Turgi," near Feldbach, has been long known, and several prehistoric
objects have been found on it from time to time. The water being low
in 1882, the Historical Society of Thurgau undertook some systematic
explorations. From various indications it was inferred that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
station was not among those destroyed by fire. The antiquities
collected belonged to the pure Stone Age, among which are:&mdash;Stone
celts, bone and horn objects, specimens of barley and wheat, cloth
made of bast, and fragments of basket-work. From the observations of
Mr. Schenk, it would appear that this pile-dwelling had been protected
from the waves by a kind of wooden bulwark. (B. 383a.)</p>

</div>

<p>Near Steckborn there was another small station, known as
"Der Pfahlbau Schanz," on which some interesting objects&mdash;as
dishes, harpoons, etc.&mdash;were found. In 1885 it was again searched
by Messikommer (B. 434b, p. 33), and among the objects then
collected were stone celts (<b><a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a></b>, No. 13),
harpoons of horn (No. 19), a flax-heckler, and an implement called a whistle
(No. 18) made of the short foot-bone of a cow. According to
Messikommer, this settlement had been twice destroyed by fire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and the usual carbonised materials&mdash;as cloth, grain, charcoal, etc.&mdash;were
abundantly found. (B. 462.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berlingen.</span>&mdash;In the bay above this
town are piles, but not readily discernible, and stone celts have been
found all along the shore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ermatingen.</span>&mdash;This settlement
occupied the bay below the village, and its site is particularly
rich in flint implements and the refuse of their manufacture. Stone
celts are also abundant, and among them are a few of nephrite. Some
fragments of pottery showing a net-like ornamentation on their inside
are noted from this locality. The station appears to have been
voluntarily abandoned, as there are no carbonised materials among its
<i>débris</i>. (B. 40 and 462.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Langenrain.</span>&mdash;Below Gottlieben,
at the north end of a small island formed by a divergent branch of
the Rhine, Dr. Nägeli, of Ermatingen, discovered in 1882 the remains
of a pile-dwelling of the Bronze Age. Some of the piles were seen
in the water projecting from the mud, but they are mostly concealed
by the deposits imported by a stream (Wollmatinger-Bach) which here
falls into the Rhine. They are partly round and partly split stems,
sharpened by metal tools, and occupy an area about 100 yards in length
and 15 in breadth. The relic-bed was covered with a layer of mud from
1 to 2&frac12; feet in thickness. Among the objects recorded from
this station are a winged celt, two lance-heads, and two hair-pins
of bronze, fragments of pottery (some of which are ornamented with
the meander pattern), and two bits of clay crescents. Also various
bones of animals and portions of a human skull, the latter being found
in the presence of Mr. Leiner at a depth of 2&frac12; feet from
the surface. (B. 462.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oberzell.</span>&mdash;The first station on the
island of Reichenau, and only lately discovered, lies to the north of
Oberzell. (B. 462.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hegne</span>, <span class="smcap">Allensbach</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Markelfingen</span>.&mdash;Of the
settlements along this part of the shore Mr. Dehoff has given a long
account in Keller's fifth report of the Pfahlbauten. (B. 61.) Since
then a new station has been discovered at Hegne, but otherwise no
important discoveries have been recorded from these stations.
They all belong to the Stone Age. At Markelfingen the piles
were observed round a small steinberg some 30 paces from the
shore, which, when the water was low, became a low island. No
piles were seen on this island, but it yielded a large number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
coarsely-made stone celts. From this place I noticed in the
Museum at Friedrichshafen a beautiful polished chisel of stone
in a staghorn handle (<b><a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a></b>, No. 1)
and a metal (copper or bronze) bracelet (No. 16).</p>

<p>Near Allensbach piles extended as a broad band for about 1,000
paces parallel to the shore. In one place rows of piles took the
direction of the shore in such a manner as to suggest a bridge or
stage entrance. The piles were generally round stems, but some of
the oak ones were split, and measured in some instances 14 to 16
inches in diameter. They projected only a few inches above the
mud. In some places horizontal beams of split oak were found
lying buried in the mud, but in deep water, and measuring
15 feet in length and 4 to 6 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The antiquities collected were chiefly the heavier implements, as
stone celts, which varied very much both in size and form&mdash;being
from less than an inch to 21 inches in length. Only a few fragments
showed perforated axes. Corn-crushers were in great abundance, as well
as flint saws and other objects of this material. Another station
just opposite Allensbach has largely supplied collectors with stone
celts, and a considerable number of perforated hammer-axes. At Hegne
the stone celts show better workmanship, and among the relics are
some beautifully-made saws, daggers, and lance-heads of yellow and
dark flint. Two earthen vessels slightly bulging in the middle, and
having perforations for cords instead of handles, are noted by Dehoff
as containing a black sooty substance, and a third was filled with
hazel-nuts.</p>

<p>The remaining stations in the Untersee are at
<span class="smcap">Iznang</span>, <span class="smcap">Gundolzen</span>,
(B. 462, p. 12), <span class="smcap">Hornstaad</span>,
<span class="smcap">Gaienhofen</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Hemmenhofen</span>, but they present the same features
as those already noticed of the Stone Age. (B. 22.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constance.</span>&mdash;In the Bay of Constance
there were several of these lake-dwellings, the remains of which have
only more recently come to light. In Keller's eighth report of the
Swiss lake-dwellings (B. 336), Mr. Leiner, keeper of the Rosgarten
Museum, gives a short account of the antiquities found in the harbour
(Rauenegg) when it was being enlarged. Among several rows of ancient
piles of oak and cross-beams running in a southerly direction towards
the Kreuzlingen shore there were found buried in the mud, chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
lying over the shell marl (<i>überkalkter Conchylien</i>), fragments of
ornamented pottery (<b><a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a></b>, Nos. 4 to 10), loom-weights,
spindle-whorls, portions of clay plaster for huts, stone celts, and
perforated axe-hammers, together with a variety of flint implements
(Nos. 11 and 12). Mr. Leiner remarks that while the pottery found in
many of the neighbouring stations was rude and entirely hand-made,
that from the Rauenegg station would almost indicate a knowledge of
the potter's wheel. This pottery was burnt into a grey, black, or
yellowish colour, and belonged to the Bronze Age; in proof of which he
instances among the antiquities a few bronze objects (Nos. 1 to 3), a
small bit of amber, and some fragments of a fine green and blue glass.
One of the bronze objects (No. 1) is quite unique, but of its purpose
nothing seems to be known.</p>

<p>In 1882 the site of a station was discovered just opposite the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
public gardens, which goes under the name <span class="smcap">Frauenpfahl</span>.
Its area was determined to be about 130 yards long and 100 yards wide.
The antiquities from it are hatchets of serpentine and chloromelanite,
fragments of vases, a large bead of blue glass, a bronze hatchet, and
a canoe.</p>

<p>During the same season (the water being then very low) another
large station was discovered, running along the north shore of the bay
near <span class="smcap">Hinterhausen</span>. It extended in length
for about 400 yards, with an average breadth of 50; and among its
piles were found some hundreds of stone hatchets, worked objects of
bone and horn, pottery, and a large assortment of the bones of various
animals. (B. 381, 382, and 462.)</p>

<p>In passing to the <i>Ueberlingersee</i> the first station we come
to is Staad, which lies immediately below Allmannsdorf; and a
little farther on there is another, opposite the village of <span
class="smcap">Egg</span>, both of which are recent additions to the
long list of lake-settlements known in this branch of the Lake of
Constance. Beyond the bridge which joins <span class="smcap">Insel
Mainau</span> to the mainland lies the <i>débris</i> of a very large
settlement which formed at least two villages. That next to <span
class="smcap">Lützelstetten</span> is characterised by its high-class
pottery of the Stone Age. Along the shore stone celts are met with
all the way to the village of <span class="smcap">Dingelsdorf</span>,
immediately opposite to which is a settlement of the Stone Age.</p>

<p>The next station was near <span class="smcap">Wallhausen</span>,
which, owing to the number of flint implements collected on it, goes
among collectors under the name of "Flint Island." Among the celts
found here are a few of nephrite and one of polished flint. (B. 462,
p. 4.) Large collections have been made from this station, one of
which, according to Mr. Böll, was lately sold for £60. (B. 378.)</p>

<p>From Wallhausen northwards neither piles nor any industrial remains
are met with till we come to Bodmann. This is, no doubt, owing to the
abrupt nature of the coast which renders the lake-margin unsuitable
for such structures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bodmann.</span>&mdash;At this town the hills
again recede, and leave an open valley stretching away westwards,
through which the stream <i>Stockach</i> flows and empties itself into the
head of the lake. Here there were two settlements which have yielded
an enormous amount of industrial remains. The most recent haul was in
1888, the largest portion of which went to the Rosgarten Museum.
When I last visited Constance (August, 1888), the stuff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
was still at Mr. Leiner's private residence, and it was perfectly
appalling to see the number of boxes, barrels, etc., in which the
materials were stowed away. Besides the Rosgarten Museum,
there are good collections from these stations at Friedrichshafen,
the Steinhaus Museum at Ueberlingen, and at Bodmann itself
(formerly in the Schloss, but now at the private residence of Mr. Ley).</p>

<p>The results of the earlier explorations have been described by
MM. Ley and Dehoff (B. 61 and 126), and some notes of the more
recent finds are given by Leiner and Böll. (B. 378, 381, and 382.)</p>

<p>The first station was close to the present landing-stage, and
the piles have been observed to hug the shore in a narrow band
for several hundred yards. In one spot measuring some 30 yards
by 10, flint implements and refuse, including all manner of chips,
were found in such astonishing quantity as to give rise to the opinion
that it was the site of a flint factory. Mr. Dehoff states that
so numerous were the flints here that, before the introduction of
lucifer matches, and as far as the memory of man goes back, it
supplied the whole neighbourhood with the flints required, and
was actually worked as a business for this purpose. Mr. Ley
describes the relic-bed as consisting of two strata, separated by
a thin layer of mud, and buried beneath a bed of gravel 1&frac14; to
2 feet thick. The lower stratum was from half a foot to a foot
thick, and lay immediately over the original lake-sediment. In
some parts this layer appeared to be covered by a thin deposit
of carbonised materials.</p>

<p>The second relic-bed was but half the thickness of the
former, and, according to Mr. Ley, it was only in it that perforated
axe-heads were found; and in its other remains, such as pottery,
he sees evidence of progress and improved handicraft.</p>

<p>Among the more noteworthy objects from Bodmann (<b><a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a></b>)
are fish-spears of horn, with two and four prongs (Nos. 3 and 5);
fish-hooks and other implements of bone (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14
and 19); a bow of yew wood; a celt and a sickle of flint; a vessel
containing no less than 600 perforated beads of Jura limestone;
goblet-like dishes of blackish earthenware with conical bases
(No. 21); and curiously-ornamented vases (No. 20); a saw in its
casing, supposed to be made of reindeer horn (No. 17); clay
spindle-whorls (No. 18). Nos. 7, 8, 14, 15, 17, and 18, are from the recent find.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
About 500 or 600 yards farther north, and close to the farthest off
point of the Ueberlingersee, Mr. Ley discovered the remains of a
second settlement, which he thinks was constructed in the Bronze Age.
Not only were bronze and iron objects found on it, but the piles are
much less decayed than those of the previously described station;
moreover, there were marks on some he had drawn up from a depth of six
feet which could only have been produced by sharp cutting implements.
It goes under the name of <span class="smcap">Schachen</span>; but it
is difficult to say from which station the numerous objects exposed in
the museums have come, as they are indiscriminately marked "Bodmann."
According to Mr. Ley, this settlement was of large extent, but the
greater part of it is deeply buried in mud, and not easily explored.
The bronze objects described by Mr. Ley are three celts, two of the
flat type (Nos. 12 and 13) and one winged (No. 11), and a pin. Those
of iron are a knife, two arrow-heads, and portion of a fish-hook. A
fibula in Rosgarten Museum marked "Bodmann" is of the Roman period
(No. 9), but this is not surprising, as there are many Roman remains
in the neighbourhood. Split beams of oak, and others with square
mortised holes (like those from Zürich, <b><a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a></b>,
Nos. 13 and 14) were fished up here, thus bearing out Keller's idea that
such beams were only used where the mud is soft. Some elegant vases, one
ornamented like those from Schussenried (No. 20), and horn objects,
are reported from it. (B. 462.) In the Museum at Ueberlingen there are
a few bronze and iron objects from Pfahlbau Bodmann, as a bracelet of
bronze wire, pins, needles, a ring, a  lance-head, and two small figurines
(<b><a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a></b>, Nos. 15 and 16).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludwigshafen.</span>&mdash;Turning the head
of the Ueberlingersee we come to the village of Ludwigshafen, where
recently piles have been detected in two places, one of which has
turned out to be exceedingly rich in staghorn implements&mdash;so
much so as to suggest the idea that it was a special factory for this
material. This station was about 30 yards from the shore, and in
the vicinity of its remains it was long known that Roman tiles lay
scattered about. These tiles are of two kinds, hollow and flat, the
latter measuring 12 by 7 inches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sipplingen.</span>&mdash;There are two stations
at Sipplingen&mdash;one, at the east end of the village, covering
nearly 30 acres. The second is only about 4 acres in extent, but
it has not been carefully explored. Its chief interest lies in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
statement made by Mr. Böll that a large quantity of wood was observed
lying in the mud, and among the beams an iron sword, believed to be of
Roman origin, was found. Close to this station was found the wreck of
a badly-constructed boat, which had no nails, but was kept together
by copper wire. (B. 378, p. 97.) The former station is the more
interesting, as it has furnished objects characteristic of the three
Ages of Stone, Bronze, and Iron, as well as of Roman, Allemanish, and
Frankish times. According to Dr. Lachmann (B. 126), the great majority
of the relics belong to the Stone Age, with very few of the Bronze
Age. Among the objects of more recent times were the following of
iron:&mdash;A lance-point, three arrow-heads, two sickles, a one-edged
sword, and a Roman key. What is still more puzzling is the finding of
glass in considerable quantities here. It is of two kinds, and one
bit was ornamented with gold enamel. Among the more recent finds are
pottery representing large vessels, with a rim and perforated knobs
for suspension, and a large flint celt weighing three pounds. (B.
378.)</p>

<p>Some goblets with conical bases, supposed to be crucibles, have
been found here, as well as at Bodmann (<b><a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a></b>,
No. 21), but they appear to me to indicate the commencement of the Bronze Age
when such forms came into general use.</p>

<p>It may be further noted that among these relics are about 100
examples of egg-shaped stones which were found in one place, a few
hatchets and chisels of nephrite, and a small copper celt encased,
when found, in a clay coating, probably the mould in which it was cast.</p>

<p>Another small station, the <i>débris</i> of which is deeply buried, was
near St. Catherina, not far from Brünnensbach, which has also yielded
objects of more recent times. (B. 462.)

<p><span class="smcap">Nussdorf.</span>&mdash;The settlement at
Nussdorf covered about three acres in the form of a parallelogram. The
piles are mostly round, generally about two feet apart, but sometimes
in groups. This station was the first discovered by Mr. Ullersberger,
in 1862, and is important for the number of antiquities it has yielded
of the pure Stone Age. Dr. Lachmann describes the early investigations
and discoveries with great minuteness. (B. 126.) Among the flint
objects were about 100 specimens of arrow-points and lance-heads
(<b><a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a></b>, Nos. 1 to 5), in all gradations of sizes,
and 80 saws, piercers, and knives. The saws were in general 3&frac12; inches
in length and 2 wide, and eight still retain their handles. Stone
celts, chisels, and hammer-axes (No. 20) numbered about 1,000, and of
these about 50 celts were made of nephrite. Horn fixings were used for
some of the celts; but there were wooden handles with a cleft, which
showed that they were hafted in a variety of ways. The perforated axes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
were comparatively rare, only about 50 being in the collection. The
perforations are both circular and oval.</p>

<p>Clay spindle-whorls (Nos. 14 and 15) and loom-weights were
well represented, but pottery was both scarce and of indifferent
quality. Of bone and horn there were several hundred objects,
including chisels (No. 8), awls, daggers (Nos. 11 to 13), various
kinds of pins (No. 10), three combs (Nos. 6 and 7), 16 perforated
hammers of staghorn (No. 23), perforated teeth, a fish-hook of
boar's tusk (No. 22), etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maurach.</span>&mdash;About half-way between
Nussdorf and Unter-Uhldingen lies the site of the famous station at
Maurach. It was discovered during the winter of 1862-3, and was among
those investigated by Mr. Ullersberger. It appears that in 1839 a dam
or dyke was built here, which covered a portion of the area occupied
by the lake-settlement, so that it could only be partially explored.
The piles came close up to the shore, but stretched out into the
lake for about 1,000 feet, covering some 8 acres. According to Dr.
Lachmann, the antiquities, about 600 of which were collected, were
precisely similar to those from Nussdorf. Stone axes were met with in
all stages of manufacture, but hardly any pottery. A flattened bead of
amber and four copper celts (<b><a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a></b>, Nos. 16 to 19)
are the only further noteworthy objects included among those from the earlier
investigations. (B. 126.)</p>

<p>It was not till 1880, when the dyke above referred to was being
repaired, that the special feature which now characterises this
settlement became known. Among the stone hatchets then found
were nearly 500 of nephrite, of which two-thirds were tolerably
well made. But more interesting is the fact that nephrite was
found in the crude state, in the form of unworked bits and chips,
from the size of a finger-nail up to 3 inches in length and 2
inches in breadth; so that there can be no doubt that this material
was worked on the spot. These later finds have gone chiefly to the
Rosgarten Museum. Mr. Leiner, writing in 1882 (B. 381), states
that from the various stations on the Ueberlingersee he received
800 nephrite, 12 jadeite, 11 chloromelanite, and one saussurite,
hatchets or chisels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unter-Uhldingen.</span>&mdash;Dr. Lachmann
describes two settlements which have left their remains near the
village of Unter-Uhldingen, about 1,000 feet from the shore and nearly
a mile apart, and each covering about 8 to 10 acres. On the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
hand, Mr. Böll makes mention of only one station, which he
characterises as the largest in Lake Constance, covering
some 30 acres. Both stations contained several well-defined
steinbergs&mdash;three in one and four in the other&mdash;in which
were cross-beams binding the piles together, like the steinberg
at Nidau. The relics belong to all ages, and indicate a continued
duration from the Stone Age down to the Roman period, if not even for
some centuries later. The Stone Age relics are similar to those found
on the other stations in the Ueberlingersee. Dr. Lachmann describes
among the flint saws one 9&frac12; inches long. The celts, chisels,
and axes numbered about 300, and the spindle-whorls 40. Pottery was
more abundantly met with here, and better made, than in any of the
other stations. About 130 fragments and whole dishes indicate a great
variety of vessels&mdash;cups, jars, vases, covers, etc. Some had
handles, and others were ornamented in a variety of ways
(<b><a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a></b>, No. 27); and, besides the Bronze Age pottery,
there were bits of red earthenware, the well-known Samian ware (<i>terra sigillata</i>)
of the Romans.</p>

<p>The special feature, however, of this station lies in the number
of bronze objects it has yielded. In the Ullersberger collection
Dr. Lachmann describes six lance-points (No. 17); 16 hatchets
with wings (Nos. 2 and 3), two with sockets (No. 1), and a few of
the flat type (Nos. 29 and 30); 25 knife-blades (Nos. 9 and 12);
four armlets, two ornamented (Nos. 21 and 22); some sickles
(No. 23), fish-hooks (Nos. 18 and 19), rings, and more than 100 hair-pins
(Nos. 4 to 8, 14, 24, and 25). Also about 40 objects of iron,
including a few lance (No. 26) and arrow-heads, one axe, several
knives, two pruning-hooks (No. 11), some iron rings, a fibula
(No. 15), portion of a two-edged sword, a short sword with a
wooden handle, an implement like a fork, a pair of pincers, etc.
Besides these, there is another collection of similar implements
of bronze and iron in the Museum of Friedrichshafen. Among the
iron objects here are two of the so-called pruning-knives (Hippen),
a hammer-axe, two harpoons, some arrow-heads and rings, a fibula
(La Tène type), six horseshoes, a dagger, and a girdle-hook.</p>

<p>Here, as well as at Sipplingen, a quantity of well-made glass
was found on the site of the settlement, consisting chiefly of
the bottoms of goblets of a greenish colour, which, according
to Mr. Hofrath Klemm, of Dresden, belonged to the sixth or
seventh century after Christ. Very few objects of bone and
horn were found at Unter-Uhldingen.

The collection of antiquities from the north shore of the
Ueberlingersee, including the settlements Nussdorf, Maurach,
Unter-Uhldingen, and Sipplingen, made by Mr. Ullersberger and
Dr. Lachmann, previous to 1865, was purchased by the Wurtemburg
Government, and is now in the Museum at Stuttgart. Since then a
considerable number of objects have been found, which are dispersed
among the local museums and private collections, as may be seen
from an inspection of the Museums at Constance, Ueberlingen,
Friedrichshafen, Bregenz, and Bodmann.</p>

<p>Leaving the northern branch of the Lake of Constance, and still
following the coast, we come, a little beyond Meersburg, to a couple
of stations, Haltnau and Hagnau, both of which subsisted during
the early Bronze Age. From <span class="smcap">Haltnau</span> a
considerable number of mixed relics, including a bronze spear-head and
hatchet, two large vases, beautiful stone chisels and perforated axes,
implements of nephrite, etc. (B. 378.) In the Rosgarten Museum there
are a few things of bronze, as a knife, a small chisel or awl, like
<b><a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a></b>, No. 13, a flat hatchet
(<b><a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a></b>, No. 3), and a pendant (No. 13).
Of late years <span class="smcap">Hagnau</span> has yielded
a large number of bronze objects, including knives (No. 9),
sickles, spirals, bracelets (No. 6), flat hatchets (Nos. 1,
2, and 4), two with wings, also pendants, lance-heads, portion of
sword-blade, and about 200 hair-pins (Nos. 7, 8, and 10). (B. 381
and 462.) The few illustrations of these objects here given are from
the Museums of Constance and Friedrichshafen. The stations at <span
class="smcap">Immenstaad</span>, <span class="smcap">Fischbach</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Manzell</span> are rich in good specimens of
jade. From Manzell comes one of the finest chloromelanite hatchets
found in this neighbourhood, and also a small one of jadeite, both of
which are in the Museum at Friedrichshafen.</p>

<p>Near Lindau, between the Villa Amsee and Aeschbach, there
appears to have been a settlement, from which a few relics have
gone to the Museums at Munich and Bregenz. (B. 462.)</p>

<p>The stations along the southern shore of the Bodensee have
not as yet been so productive in industrial remains as those of
the more sheltered Untersee and Ueberlingersee, but nevertheless
there is sufficient evidence to show that they existed along
the coast, as will be seen from the following list of their
sites, which are successively met with between Rorschach and the
town of Constance, viz. <span class="smcap">Arbon</span>,
<span class="smcap">Romanshorn</span>, <span class="smcap">Kesswil</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Moosburg</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Rothfarb</span> near Güttingen, <span class="smcap">Altnau</span>,
<span class="smcap">Landschlacht</span>, <span class="smcap">Münsterlingen</span>,
<span class="smcap">Bottighofen</span>, and <span class="smcap">Kreuzlingen</span>.
With the exception of the station at Arbon, the remains of these
settlements consist of more or fewer piles, and a sprinkling of stone
and flint implements. The shore from Kreuzlingen to Constance was
found in 1882 to be continuously studded with piles, and among them a
large number of relics was picked up, including several implements of
nephrite and jadeite, an amber bead, and a large flint hatchet. (B.
462.) The two fragments of stone axes, Nos. 14 and 15, illustrated on
<b><a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a></b>, are from this part of the lake.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bleiche-Arbon.</span>&mdash;In 1885 Messikommer
relates that during the very low state of the lake in 1882 he was
requested to visit Arbon, and make an inquiry regarding the discovery
of some prehistoric implements along the shore, which were supposed to
indicate the existence of a lake-dwelling in the neighbourhood. In the
places referred to he found some flint saws and other implements, but,
notwithstanding his well-known experience in lake-dwelling research,
he failed to find piles; and the only result of his visit was the
discovery of the ruins of a Roman watch-tower near the mouth of the harbour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>


<p>On the 19th of September, 1885, Messikommer again received
a message from the authorities of Arbon to repair to their town,
as this time there could be no doubt that the remains of a true
Pfahlbau had been found. The site of this new discovery was
not the seashore, but the flat land stretching between Arbon
and Steinach. Here, in the course of excavations for a water
supply to the town, the workmen came upon piles with cross-timbers,
among which were interspersed various relics of human
industry. The place where these discoveries were made was
about a kilomètre from Arbon, and close by the road to St.
Gallen. On a section being exposed, the following layers were
observed:&mdash;First half a foot of soil, then a foot of loam, and
under this a stratified deposit of sand and gravel, about 3 feet
in thickness, containing fresh-water shells. The relic-bed was
from 1 foot to 1&frac12; foot thick, and in it were found stone hatchets;
fragments of sawn stones, apparently the refuse of manufactured
implements; corn-crushers; four perforated horn hammers, "<i>Feldhacken</i>;"
several bone objects&mdash;needles, chisels, awls, daggers;
a knife-like implement made of a wild boar's tusk, and another made
of yew-wood; an oar; fragments of ornamented pottery, etc. Also
there were barley, numerous seeds and fruits, shells of hazel-nuts,
the skull of a dog, and a quantity of osseous remains, representing
the urus, bison, stag, cow, pig, bear, etc. (B. 431, 434c, and 462.)</p>

<h3>MINDLISEE AND BUSSENSEE.</h3>

<p>In the vicinity of Constance are two small lakes or bogs
which have yielded important remains of lake-dwellings.
These are the <span class="smcap">Bussensee</span> and <span
class="smcap">Mindlisee</span>, both situated in the tract of country
stretching between the Untersee and the Ueberlingersee. The former is
near Lützelstetten, and in its marginal peat there have been found the
following antiquities:&mdash;A wooden dish cut out of an alder-trunk,
measuring 13 inches in diameter; two amber beads&mdash;one a
perforated disc 1&frac12; inch in diameter (<b><a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a></b>,
No. 8), similar to one found at Ober-Meilen, and said to have been in the
possession of the late Mr. Aepli, and the other a small ordinary bead
(No. 9). Also several articles of stone, horn, copper, and bronze. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
curiosity is a portion of the shell of a tortoise perforated with
two holes for suspension (No. 17). Also a female human skull of the
dolichocephalic  type.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The Mindlisee is near Möggingen, and its Pfahlbau is more
difficult of investigation, owing to the bogginess of the peat.
Some of the antiquities from this locality, and now in the
Museum at Constance, consist of fragments of pottery, two ornamented
pins and a dagger of copper (Nos. 2, 3 and 11), some bronze
objects (Nos. 14 and 15), and a curiously shaped stone, like a
hatchet and handle in one piece (No. 12). (B. 381 and 462.)</p>

<h3>FEDERSEE.</h3>

<p>The settlement in the Federsee was reported on by Oberförster
Frank, of Schussenried, in 1876, being the result of systematic
investigations conducted by him during the previous year. (B. 285.)
It was situated in the south-east corner of an extensive tract
of peat which now largely occupies the ancient basin of the
Federsee, at a place about three miles distant from the present
small lake, and 380 yards from its ancient or glacial margin. Immediately
over the glacial <i>débris</i> in which this basin is formed
there lies a layer of whitish clay, "Weissergrund," about 15 inches
thick, and then follows peat for a thickness of 10 or 12 feet.
The lake-dwelling remains are met with at a depth of 6&frac12; feet,
but it is impossible to form a correct idea of the extent of the
entire settlement, as it is only a portion that has been exposed.
At this depth in the peat wooden platforms are met with, formed
of layers of round or split timbers lying transversely one above
the other, and forming a kind of fascine structure. Between the
wooden layers there is always placed a bed of clay, the number
of which varies from three to eight, so that there is no uniformity
in the thickness represented by these structures.</p>

<p>Inserted through these solid masses of clay and wood, at
intervals of about 2&frac14; feet, were upright beams, only some of
which reached the Weissergrund. These piles were slender, only about
4 inches in diameter, and showed no evidence of having either
mortises or tenons by which they could be joined with the horizontal beams.</p>

<p>Relics were found not only on the surface of these fascine
structures, but also in the clay between the successive layers or
platforms, and even underneath the lowest, down as far as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Weissergrund, but never actually in the latter. Between the lowest
layers of woodwork and the Weissergrund there is sometimes a space of
4 or 5 feet in which horns, broken bones, and other relics are found;
but it is "above and between the horizontal layers of timbers, and
chiefly in the immediate neighbourhood of the upright piles, that
implements of all kinds are met with&mdash;of flint, stone, horn,
bone, teeth, and wood; also earthenware vessels and spoons quite perfect."</p>

<p>In June, 1879, Mr. Frank was fortunate in finding the actual
foundation of a hut, showing the flooring and portions of the
side walls, the dimensions and other particulars of which I will
afterwards discuss.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>There was no evidence that this settlement, like so many in
Switzerland, came to an end by means of a conflagration; and,
indeed, the freshness of the upper woodwork and the absence of
burnt faggots, etc., negatived the idea of such a catastrophe.</p>

<p>The antiquities found on these remarkable peat dwellings
are supposed to belong exclusively to the Stone Age, as hitherto
no objects of metal have been found among them (<b><a href="#Fig_34">Figs. 34</a></b>
and <b><a href="#Fig_35">35</a></b>).</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;A large quantity of whole and broken dishes are
in Mr. Frank's collection. They are sometimes of a greyish colour,
and at other times black, as if polished with soot or graphite. The
paste is either fine and smooth or mixed with coarse sand, and it is
of this latter quality that the larger vessels are made. Of some 140
specimens in Mr. Frank's collection the largest is 12 inches high.
Both handles and perforated knobs have been in use. A few fragments
of a fine yellowish paste are highly ornamented (<b><a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a></b>,
Nos. 17, 24, and 25). The fine black pottery consists of pretty jars,
bowls, spoons, etc., which are often ornamented with a combination of
lines, points, checks, knobs, etc. It is curious that there are no
spindle-whorls, and only one object that can be considered to be a loom-weight.

<i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Flint implements to the number of 40, such as saws,
arrow-points, and scrapers, are well made (Nos. 1 to 8). One
semicircular saw is interesting as being a northern type, which,
however, is not in Mr. Frank's collection, but in the Museum of
Natural History at Stuttgart (No. 20). Of several stone hatchets
some are plain and others perforated and beautifully polished,
a few of which are still in their horn or wooden handles (Nos. 9
to 14 and 19). (No horn holders with square tops for insertion
into wooden handles are in the collection.) The stone implements
are generally made of granite or serpentine, one only being of
jadeite (sp. gr. 3·360). A small bit of red stone is perforated
with three holes, precisely like similar objects from Robenhausen
(<b><a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a></b>, Nos. 5 and 6).</p>

</div>

<p><i>Horn and Bone, etc.</i>&mdash;- Of horn there are two scoops
(<b><a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a></b>, No. 6), and some perforated hammers (No. 7),
one of which has portion of the wooden handle in it. There are also spoons of horn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
as well as small bone chisels, daggers, pins, knives, haftings, etc.
(<b><a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a></b>, Nos. 15 and 16), perforated teeth,
and some cutting implements of boars' teeth. Portion of the handle of a stone
celt, still in its socket, is interesting, as showing a wedge which had
been inserted so as to fix it more thoroughly, just as is done at the
present day. A piece of wood, showing clearly the marks of a
stone axe, is preserved by Mr. Frank in a liquid, as well as various
wooden dishes.</p>

<p><i>Organic and other Remains.</i>&mdash;Bits of rope and coarse matting
made of bast, but no cloth, were found. As regards the latter, it
was with special interest that I was shown a large consolidated
mass of a black material, made of grains of wheat, which most
distinctly retained the impression of a finely woven tissue, evidently
that of the sack in which the grain had been kept. Other curious
objects are two lumps of asphalt, one of which weighs three-quarters
of a pound, and a dish filled with birch-bark in little rolls.
Dr. Dom, of Tübingen,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
believes that this so-called asphalt was a product of birch-bark, used
by the lake-dwellers when mixed with a black powder for smearing over
their dishes.</p>

<p>The eminent Professor Fraas, of Stuttgart, identified the
following animals among the osseous remains submitted to him,
viz. stag, roe, pig, bear, wolf, fox, lynx, hare, and bison (wild);
and the dog, ox, marsh-pig, and sheep (domestic). It is noteworthy
that neither the horse nor goat is here represented. (B. 303.)</p>

<p>Wheat, found plentifully, was determined by Professor Hegelmaier
to be a large-grained variety of the common species
(<i>Triticum vulgare</i>). Among other fruits and seeds were linseed,
acorns, beech-nuts, hazel-nuts, etc. Pine was not among the wood.</p>

<p>In a jar was found a greyish-black powder, which on analysis
proved to be carbonate of lime in combination with a bituminous
substance. Another powder was found to be red oxide of iron.</p>

<p>One small bead, of bright red colour, like coral, finds a place
in the Schussenried Collection; but the following objects are
wanting, viz. clay ring supports, leather, cloth, bread, apples
and pears, usually found in lake-dwellings.</p>

<p>From the facts recorded in Mr. Frank's long article, it would
appear that the settlers at Schussenried commenced their residence
before the girdle of peat, which now covers so largely the ancient
bed of the Federsee, extended very far from the shore assigned to
it by the retiring glaciers; and that since they abandoned their
dwellings not less than 6 or 7 feet of peat have grown over them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<h3>OLZREUTHERSEE.</h3>

<p>About two kilomètres north-east of Schussenried lies a small
lake&mdash;Olzreuthersee&mdash;in which Mr. Frank has discovered the
remains of a Pfahlbau of similar character to that just described.</p>

<p>Being informed that flint and staghorn implements were turned
up in a field close to this lake, he at once visited the spot, and
recognised the site of a lake-dwelling, situated in a small peninsula
some 800 square yards in extent, and rising 1&frac12; foot above the
water, which enclosed it on three sides. Here woodwork, pottery, and
other <i>débris</i> of human occupancy were found embedded in a relic-bed
rather less than a foot in thickness. The pottery was much broken,
but it resembled that from Schussenried, both in quality and style
of ornamentation. As at Schussenried also, neither spindle-whorls
nor net-weights were found. Of 784 bits of flint collected, 178
were worked. They are thus classified:&mdash;47 arrow-points, 57
scrapers, 38 knives, 16 saws, and 20 of an undetermined character.
Some of the arrow-points and saws are particularly well made. Of stone
implements there were 11 axes of local materials (a few of which were
perforated), and 3 hatchets and 4 chisels of nephrite. The nephrite
hatchets were small, the largest measuring only 1&frac12; inch by
1&frac14; inch, and the chisels were 2 inches to 3 inches in length
by &frac14; inch to 1 inch in breadth. There were besides several
corn-crushers, 28 staghorn implements, some perforated, and rolls of
birch-bark, etc., but no trace of any metal. Also a few needles, awls,
and small chisels.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank draws attention to the remarkable fact, that while
here there were nephrite objects, and no jadeite, the very opposite
was the case at Schussenried. (B. 395.)</p>

<h3>DANUBIAN BASIN.</h3>

<p>Crossing over to the great Bavarian plateau which commands
the sources of the Danube, there are on the northern flanks of
the Alpine chain of mountains a series of lakes, many of which
have been shown to contain remains of lake-dwellings. Those
which have been sufficiently investigated to claim a notice here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
are the following:&mdash;Würmsee, Mondsee, Fuschlsee, Attersee, and Neusiedlersee.</p>

<h3>LAKE OF STARNBERG (WÜRMSEE).</h3>

<p>The Lake of Starnberg lies about 18 miles to the south of Munich,
close to the spurs of the great Alpine chain of mountains. The
coast is an undulating upland, interspersed with woods, villas,
pleasure-grounds, and pretty villages&mdash;a passing glimpse of
which, together with a constant view of the snow-clad mountains in
the distance, renders a trip on this lake one of the most enjoyable
attractions to Munich. At its northern end, where its surplus water is
carried off by the Würm, it is only about a mile in breadth, but as
we sail southwards it expands considerably, and ultimately attains a
breadth of three or four miles, with a total length of 12 miles. About
four miles up on its western side there is a low but prettily wooded
island, called Rosen Insel since 1850, because it was then purchased
by the King of Bavaria. Here a royal residence was built on the ruins
of an old ecclesiastical establishment, and when its foundations
were being dug various sepulchral remains of a mixed character were
met with&mdash;prehistoric, Roman, and mediæval. Tradition says that
the island was originally the site of a heathen temple and a sacred
burying-place, which was subsequently appropriated by the Christians
and used for similar purposes.</p>

<p>When Professor Desor visited the locality in 1864 in search of
lake-dwelling remains, he found on the western margin of this island
numerous piles, associated with some antiquities of the lacustrine
kind so largely found in the Swiss lakes, from which he concluded that
this was the site of a pile-village, and suggested that the whole
island might be of an artificial nature. During the following year
some further excavations were made, but no important results ensued
beyond corroborating the opinion of Desor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
In 1874, however, advantage was taken of the low state of the water,
and extensive excavations were made under the superintendence of Mr.
v. Schab, the Government law-officer at Starnberg. Numerous shafts
were dug on the margin of the island, and in all cases a relic-bed
was encountered containing antiquities, apparently of very different
ages. Not only was there abundance of the usual relics of the Stone
Age, but also some of bronze, iron, glass, amber, etc. The collection
of objects then made is thus summarised in Mr. v. Schab's report (B.
291):&mdash;Of staghorn 187, bronze 158, stone 69, bone 48, wood 7,
iron 6, glass 3, and amber 1. The collection is deposited in the
Ethnological Museum of Munich, from which I have had the privilege of
taking most of the accompanying illustrations (<b><a href="#Fig_36">Figs. 36</a></b> and
<b><a href="#Fig_37">37</a></b>). There appear to be more objects in the case in the Museum
from the Starnberg lake-dwelling than Von Schab describes, as, for
example, the bronze socketed celt (<b><a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a></b>, No. 9), but on
the other hand it is well known that some have fallen into private hands.</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;The flint from this station is of a bluish-grey
colour, and does not correspond with the French kind. The articles
made from this substance are chips, arrow-points, lance-heads,
scrapers, saws, etc. (<b><a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a></b>, Nos. 14 and 15). Of nephrite
there <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
are one or two specimens in the form of small cutting implements;
of ordinary stone celts there are a few more or less
perfect (No. 17), and one is in a horn casing (No. 12); also
some polishers, and grindstones.</p>

<p><i>Horn, etc.</i>&mdash;Various kinds of hafting; about 12
bridle-guiders, a few of which are whole (Nos. 2 and 3); several
perforated hammer-axes (Nos. 11 and 13); bone daggers, perforated
boars' tusks, awls, etc. The most remarkable objects are two or three
large bone discs ornamented (<b><a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a></b>, Nos. 24 and 30).</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;Portion of a solid bracelet ornamented with lines
and concentric circles, awls and chisels (Nos. 5 and 19), knives
(Nos. 1, 2, and 7), daggers (No. 8), hatchets (Nos. 9, 12, and 20),
ornamented pins (Nos. 3, 4, 6, etc.), fibulæ (Nos. 21 and 22), needles
(No. 13), arrow-points (No. 14), fish-hooks (No. 27), one sickle (No.
18), portion of an ornamented plate (No. 25).</p>

<p><i>Iron.</i>&mdash;A large knife (<b><a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a></b>, No. 1),
a horseshoe, two spear-heads.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Fragments of pottery were very numerous, probably
indicating 100 vessels; but no entire dish is among them. The
ornamentation is varied, and consists sometimes of parallel grooves,
like that of the terramara pottery in North Italy (<b><a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a></b>,
No. 16). The paste used was also of a varied quality. Spindle-whorls
of various sizes and forms, clay support-rings, and conical and
quadrilateral clay weights; also large beads of burnt clay of an
orange colour, ornamented with concentric circles of blue and white
(<b><a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a></b>, No. 17).</p>

<p><i>Glass, etc.</i>&mdash;A few glass beads of variegated colours (No.
23), and one of amber.</p>

<p><i>Wood.</i>&mdash;Wooden wedges, spoons, a fragment of basket-work, etc.</p>

<p><i>Organic Remains.</i>&mdash;Hazel-nuts, burnt corn, and various other
seeds. As to osseous remains, those of the domestic animals were twice
as numerous as those of the wild species. It may be interesting to
note that amongst the latter are included the reindeer (one portion of
a horn), cat (one lower jaw of large size), beaver (four individuals),
and two kinds of dog (<i>Canis familiaris</i> and <i>matris opt.</i>).</p>

<h3>MONDSEE.</h3>

<p>A couple of miles to the west of the southern end of the
Attersee lies the Mondsee, followed farther up in the same valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
by the small lake of Fuschl, both of which send their united surplus
water into the former. Just opposite the outlet of the Mondsee, at a
place called See, the site of a very interesting lake-dwelling was
discovered, which since 1872 has been very carefully investigated by
Dr. Much, of Vienna, with the result that this indefatigable explorer
is now in possession of one of the most instructive collections of
lake-dwelling remains in Europe. The <span class="smcap">See</span>
station covered an area of some 3,500 square yards. The piles were
round, 3&frac12; inches to 8 inches in diameter, and irregularly
placed, and the relic-bed was deeply covered with mud. The
antiquities, many of which are here illustrated (<b><a href="#Fig_38">Figs. 38</a></b>,
<b><a href="#Fig_39">39</a></b>, and <b><a href="#Fig_40">40</a></b>), may be thus classified.</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Flint arrow-points, in great numbers, are of a
triangular shape and very neatly made. One or two have still traces
of asphalt, by means of which they were attached to the stem
(<b><a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a></b>, Nos. 10 to 12). Some of them are in an unfinished
state, and one is of transparent rock-crystal. Among the flint saws are several
half-moon-shaped implements similar to those so frequently met with
in the Scandinavian archæological area (Nos. 2 to 4). Some of this
type were made with a projection for a handle like the knives used by
modern leather-cutters. Lance-heads and scrapers are also numerous and
well made. From the presence of a quantity of chips and flint refuse
there can be no doubt that all these implements were manufactured
<i>in situ</i>, a remark which equally applies to the knives (Krummesser)
of Danish type, which were made of the same kind of flint, the raw
material for which could be readily found in the gravel of the
neighbouring streams. Among the ordinary stone implements are about
two dozen perforated and highly finished axe-hammer heads (Nos. 13 to
15). The material is often a variegated serpentine. The polished celts
amount to nearly 100 specimens, of which the largest is 6&frac34;
inches long and the smallest 1&frac14; inch. One highly polished
circular stone with central perforation might have formed the head of
a club (<b><a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a></b>, No. 9).</p>

<p><i>Horn and Bone.</i>&mdash;Of this class of remains, there is a
remarkable assortment of chisels (<b><a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a></b>, Nos. 16, 27,
and 28), pointers, etc., and particularly noteworthy are the
double-pronged daggers (<b><a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a></b>, Nos. 9 and 12).
These are invariably well made and beautifully polished, and some have a groove
as if for attaching a string. There is only one staghorn hafting for
a celt, and it is bored in the middle for a handle, but the number of
perforated hammers of this material is considerable. One triangular
arrow-point is of bone (<b><a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a></b>, No. 23).

<i>Metal.</i>&mdash;From the commencement of the investigation of this
settlement it was inferred, from the finding of a number of coarse
crucibles with projecting handles, that its inhabitants were
acquainted with the art of smelting. Not only was there a little
copper found in the pores of these utensils, but there were, among the
wooden objects, some crooked clubs with a slit at the end
(<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 14), which could only be used as
handles for flat celts such as those generally made of copper. Within the last
few years these surmises have been confirmed by the discovery of several metal
objects, chiefly of copper, among which are:&mdash;14 flat celts
(some are in a fragmentary condition) (<b><a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a></b>,
Nos. 1, 2, and 5), six daggers (Nos. 3, 4, and 6), three spirals, three awls,
one fish-hook (No. 14), and two small indefinite objects. Of bronze there
are only two articles, viz. a portion of a dagger showing rivet-holes,
and a portion of the stalk of a pin.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;The larger vessels are made of coarse clay mixed
with sand, and are both clumsy and unornamented, with the exception
sometimes of nail marks round the rim. Instead of handles they
have perforated knobs below the rim or on the bulge of the vessel.
In striking contrast to these coarse dishes are richly ornamented
jugs made of a fine paste, and other small dishes with or without
handles. The ornamentation is peculiar, consisting of deep broad
lines, arranged in a variety of patterns, in which a white chalky
substance was inserted, and to retain it better the bottom of the
incised lines was sometimes corrugated (<b><a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a></b>, No. 6).
The colour of this pottery is now greyish, but originally it is supposed
to have been black, so that the white ornamentation on a black ground
must have had a striking effect. A few objects of clay, in the form
of rude figurines, which might be conceived to represent some common
quadruped, as a dog, or a pig, or a cow, may also be noted
(<b><a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a></b>, No. 15).</p>

<p><i>Other Objects.</i>&mdash;It is somewhat remarkable that in the whole
of this large collection there are only three small perforated objects
of stone which could be taken for spindle-whorls, and only one clay
weight; nor is there anything else that would indicate the art of weaving,
with the exception of a few knotted strings and a closely plaited mat made of bast.

The personal ornaments are very various. Perforated teeth, imitations
of the claws of birds in white marble (<b><a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a></b>, No. 22),
and circular plates of marble in the form of buttons, beads, etc.
(<b><a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a></b>, Nos. 13 and 16). In one place not less than
48 of the latter were brought up at one haul of the dredger, which, when restored in
order, reproduce a bracelet (No. 16).</p>

<p>In 1874 Dr. Much discovered a second station at <span
class="smcap">Scharfling</span> on the south shore of the Mondsee,
but being in deep water, and subject to the deposition of much
<i>débris</i> brought down by the Kienbach, the difficulties of a thorough
investigation have not yet been overcome.</p>

<p>Of the investigations conducted from time to time in the Mondsee,
and the antiquities collected, Dr. Much has given several accurate
reports. (B. 223, 257, and 287.)</p>

<h3>ATTERSEE (UPPER AUSTRIA).</h3>

<p>The first notices of investigations of the lake-dwellings in the
Attersee were published in 1871 by Count Wurmbrand and Mr. Simony, and
these were continued by the former during the following five years,
according as fresh discoveries were made. (B. 200, 201a, 202, 229, and
276.) There were five settlements in the lake&mdash;one,
<span class="smcap">Seewalchen</span>, near the outlet; two, <span class="smcap">Attersee</span>
and <span class="smcap">Aufham</span>, on the west shore; and two, <span class="smcap">Weyeregg</span>
and <span class="smcap">Puschacher</span>, on the east shore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seewalchen.</span>&mdash;This settlement
formed an irregular quadrangle, some 500 by 180 feet, and distant
from the nearest shore between 200 and 300 feet. The water here is
about 5 feet deep, and though clear, no relics or piles are visible,
as the <i>débris</i> are covered over with a bed of gravel, which had to
be removed by dredging. The piles were round timbers 6 to 8 inches in
diameter, and 3 to 4 feet apart, which penetrated so deeply into the
shell-marl that it was with difficulty any of them could be pulled up.
The relic-bed was a blackish conglomerate of organic <i>débris</i>, about a
foot thick, and greatly compressed by the superincumbent gravel. Count
Wurmbrand does not think this settlement had been destroyed by fire,
as the usual symptoms of such a catastrophe are entirely wanting. The
antiquities, though numbering among them a few metal objects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
are essentially of the Stone Age, among which the following are
the most typical.</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;The arrow-points of flint are all triangularly
shaped, no example with a central stem having been discovered. One
remarkable object is a small knife-flake of obsidian. Stone celts (a
few perforated and mostly broken) were made of diorite, greenstone,
granite, hornblende, etc., but none of nephrite. Grinding and
polishing stones were abundant.</p>

<p><i>Horn and Bone.</i>&mdash;Of these materials there were pointers (some
with double prongs), chisels, scrapers, but none of the haftings for
celts, such as those so frequently met with on the sites of the Swiss
lake-dwellings; some bone rings, probably intended for beads, and
others of cannel-coal.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Pottery was not abundant, but judging from its
character, Count Wurmbrand thought that it was smeared over with
graphite or some colouring matter, and burnt in an open fire. The
ornamentation was made with the finger-nail, or with small pointed
implements, in the soft clay. Some fragments showed handles and others
perforated knobs.</p>

<p><i>Metal.</i>&mdash;Two small bronze pins, one with conical head, and
perforated in the stem a little below the head. It is quadrilateral
in its lower two-thirds, and ornamented with dots. The other objects
are an awl, sharpened at both ends, a lump of bronze, and two small
fragments of iron.</p>

<p>The animal remains belonged to the pig, bear, beaver, ox, and stag.</p>

<p>Among the woods used were fir, lime, beech, oak, hazel, birch,
and cornel-cherry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weyeregg.</span>&mdash;The station next
in importance is Weyeregg, about a third of the way up the lake.
It has yielded well-made bone implements, worked tines of horns,
perforated boars' teeth, and some finely polished stone hatchets.
One is of a sea-green colour like jade, and another has an elegant
form (<b><a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a></b>, No. 22). Latterly a few metal objects
have been found on this station, among which are the two daggers here
represented (Nos. 17 and 18). On the remaining stations only a few
objects of stone and pottery have been collected, sufficient, however,
to show that they were similar to those already described. On <span
class="smcap">Puschacher</span> there were found two half-moon-shaped
flint knives (Krummesser) (Nos. 20 and 21), and a round stone ball
of polished serpentine neatly perforated, supposed to have been a mace.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<h3>FUSCHLSEE.</h3>

<p>On the south shore of Lake Fuschl there is a small island of
circular form, and about 50 paces in diameter, which, it seems, is
of artificial construction, and strikingly analogous to our Scottish
and Irish crannogs. The island, which is a little raised above the
level of the water, lies close to the shore, being only separated
from it by a narrow ditch or canal, which in the course of time has
got filled up with moss and the <i>débris</i> of marsh plants. On digging
a hole in its interior there was encountered first a thick layer of
moss and heather, and then a mass of decayed wood, chiefly branches of
pine and dwarf birch. This mass was kept together by small piles, but
around the margin there were stronger piles and a quantity of other
beams to be seen. Few antiquities were, however, found on it, and its
investigation from this point of view did not seem very encouraging.
(B. 257.)</p>

<h3>NEUSIEDLERSEE.</h3>

<p>Over the vast territory drained by the Danube there are some
further lacustrine remains indicative of lake or pile dwellings, but
which are probably only a small fraction of what could be revealed
with careful and systematic research. In 1872 Jeitteles published
a notice of pile structures discovered in the town of Olmütz (B. 221);
and more recently at Nimlau, in the same neighbourhood, similar
wooden structures were detected in a pond. In this case there
were five rows of oak piles associated with cross-beams; each
row was five feet apart, and the whole was covered with mud to the
extent of nearly two feet.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>

</div>

<p>In 1874 Count Béla Széchenyi (B. 283) made some important
discoveries at the south end of the bed of the Neusiedlersee, which
can hardly be explained on any other hypothesis than that they were
the industrial <i>débris</i> of a lake-dwelling. This is a large lake of
brackish water measuring about 72 miles in circumference, but so
shallow that in its deepest part it attains only a depth of 10 or 12
feet. It terminates at its south-east side in a swamp called Hanság,
("floating turf"), of greater extent than the lake itself. It appears
to be subject to great fluctuations in its extent, so much so that
in 1854 its area commenced to decrease till in a few years later its
bed became completely dried up. Cultivation of the land occupied by
it was then begun, but the water has since returned. It was in 1874,
on land reclaimed from this lake in these circumstances, that Count
Széchenyi found, scattered over the surface, bits of pottery, stone
celts, flint implements, etc. On making systematic investigations
of these finds, along with some of his scientific friends, he found
that in two spots these relics were met with in greater profusion,
and that, corresponding with these productive areas, there was a
substratum of blackish mould which became more clearly defined by the
rankness of its vegetation. These were supposed to have been the sites
of habitation, and accordingly excavations were undertaken to clear up
the matter, but they revealed nothing new. Only the same classes of
relics were found as on the surface, with the exception of a few bones
very much decayed. No piles were observed, and after digging to the
depth of about three feet water came into the trenches and so stopped
further progress in this direction. About 100 square yards were
explored, during which the following relics were collected:&mdash;31
perforated stone axes or hammers, of which only two were whole;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
96 plain stone axes, of which about two-thirds were well formed,
the rest being more or less fragmentary; six stone chisels, and
14 worked stones or polishers, corn-grinders, etc.; a net-sinker and
two small beads, together with a few scrapers and flint-flakes; and
pottery to the amount of 200 to 300 fragments, among which only
three vases were still entire. Illustrations of some of these relics
are given on <b><a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a></b>, Nos. 1 to 9.</p>

<p>The osseous remains were much decayed, but among them the
following animals were identified, viz. stag, urus, ox, pig,
and horse (represented only by two teeth).</p>

<p>Flints were comparatively rare, but the stone implements were
varied both in form and material, being made of such materials
as serpentine, diorite, basalt and schist.</p>

<p>The pottery, though rude, appeared to have been partly made
on the wheel, but yet had finger-nail marks and other curved
impressions as ornamentation. All sorts of handles were used, from
mere perforations for strings to the most perfectly made handle.
The paste was mixed with coarse materials.</p>

<p>The non-appearance of piles and organic matter may probably be
accounted for by their rapid decomposition from alternate exposure
to air and water.</p>

<p>Further notices of these finds were given by Count Wurmbrand
(B. 259), Dr. Much (B. 318), and Von Luschan (B. 365).</p>

<h3>PILE STRUCTURES IN HUNGARY.</h3>

<p>On the right bank of the Theiss, a few miles from the railway-station
of Szolnok, and near the village of Tószeg, there is an
artificial mound called "Kuczorgó or Lapos-halom," to which, since
the meeting of the International Congress at Buda-Pesth, in 1876,
much importance is attached on account of the opinion expressed
by Pigorini that it is identical in structure with the terramara
mounds of Northern Italy. The mound, though now considerably
undermined by the river Theiss during the great floods of 1876, is
still of considerable extent, measuring some 360 mètres in length,
and 100 in breadth, and rising to a maximum height of 8 mètres
over the surrounding plain. It is only in times of flood that the
waters reach the mound, its usual bed being about 1&frac12; mile
distant. When the artificial nature of this mound became known
by the section exposed by the floods, some extensive investigations
were made to determine its archæological character. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
objects collected in these researches were exhibited at the
Congress as a special find, and among them were the following
(Catalogue, pp. 85-87):&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Perforated hammers of staghorn, various pointed implements
of horn and bone, perforated teeth of pigs, and a leg-bone perforated
in two places, probably a skate.</p>

<p>2. Polished stone celts and perforated hammers, four flint
flakes, and one of obsidian, corn-crushers, and various other worked
stones.</p>

<p>3. Fragment of a bronze pin, a bronze knife, and a small ingot
of bronze.</p>

<p>4. Pottery, showing a variety of dishes, some with handles, etc.;
various objects of burnt clay, as a whistle, buttons, a spoon, 18
pyramidal clay weights (perforated), etc.</p>

<p>5. A considerable amount of food refuse, as bones, scales of
fish, shells, charred wheat, etc.</p>

<p>When the International Congress was held at Buda-Pesth,
Pigorini, Virchow, and Miss Mestorf visited this mound, and made
some further researches, which not only confirmed Pigorini in his
suspicions about the structure of the mound, but also led his
distinguished fellow investigators to accept the main portion of
his theory. Upon their return home they<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
published separate accounts of this excursion to Tószeg and the
results obtained, from which I must here be content to notice that the
following propositions are admitted facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The existence of piles and wooden beams was satisfactorily
proved, and Pigorini asserts that these corresponded with three
different levels, precisely as they occur in the terramara mounds.</p>

<p>2. The materials containing the <i>débris</i> of occupancy were
distinctly stratified, forming parallel or undulating layers, amounting
to a total thickness of 4 mètres.</p>

<p>3. The antiquities collected represented all ages, including stone
celts, bronze and iron implements, and a skate made of the leg-bone
of a horse.</p>

<p>Subsequently Dr. Romer gave an account of the excavations
conducted at Tószeg previous to the meeting of the International
Congress, in an article entitled "Les Terramares en Hongrie,"
along with which he describes similar deposits at other places, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Nagy-Rév, Szelevény, Keménytetö, and Ásott-halom. In regard to
the latter station he remarks that rotten piles were observed in its
lowest stratum before Pigorini called attention to their importance.
Some of the objects from Ásott-halom were exhibited at the
Congress (see Cat., p. 44), and included polished stone axes and
hammers, flakes of obsidian, perforated hammers of staghorn, etc.
The author concludes his article by stating that the terramara
deposits are by no means confined to the valley of the Tisza, as
they have already been observed in various other low-lying districts
along the Danube, Garam, etc. (B. 316.)</p>

<h3>RESEARCHES IN THE LAKES OF CARINTHIA AND CARNIOLA.</h3>

<p>In 1864 Professor Ferdinand v. Hochstetter gave a report
of researches conducted by him, at the request of the Royal
Academy of Sciences of Vienna, in the lakes of Carinthia and
Carniola in search of remains of lake-dwellings. (B. 98.) But
the results were, in the main, of a negative character, as no traces
whatever were found in the lakes of Millstätter, Afritzer, Brenn,
and Weissen, in Carinthia; nor in those of Weldeser, Wocheiner,
and Zirknitzer, in Carniola. In the latter lake it was confidently
expected that lake-dwelling remains would be discovered, as the
chronicler Valvasor (1689) relates that in this lake there was
an old bridge, whose piles he himself had seen; but upon
Von Hochstetter and Deschmann visiting the locality nothing
whatever could be seen of this character.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Von Hochstetter believed that he had succeeded
in finding traces of these settlements in no less than five lakes in
Carinthia, viz. <i>Wörther</i>, <i>Keutschacher</i>, <i>Rauschelen</i>, <i>Ossiacher</i>,
and <i>Längsee</i>. The <i>Keutschachersee</i> is, however, the only one which
has yielded positive remains of a sufficiently varied character to
render the evidence of Pfahlbauten more than problematical. This small
lake, known also as the <i>Plaschischersee</i>, which lies to the south of
the Wörthersee, contains near its middle a shallow portion which can
be readily distinguished from the shore by the rushes which grow over
it. The area of the space thus marked out is not great, measuring only
20 fathoms long (Klafter) by 10 fathoms broad, and it is covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
by water never less than 4 to 6 feet in depth. Here piles and large
beams were seen embedded among stones and mud, but so firmly that they
could not be drawn up. Notwithstanding the difficulty of examination,
some relics of human occupancy were collected. These, which were
subsequently augmented by a further investigation by Mr. Ullepitsch,
of Klagenfurt, are deposited in the museum of that town; they consist
of portions of half-burnt clay with the impression of wattling, and
are supposed to be part of the walls of a cottage. There are also
one or two fragments of black and grey pottery, one of which is
ornamented (<b><a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a></b>, No. 10); a sharpening or grinding
stone; a bit of staghorn, together with charcoal; heaps of shells (<i>Adonta</i>);
hazel-nuts, and portion of a wooden pile.</p>

<p>Dr. v. Hochstetter draws attention to the extraordinary number
of submerged cairns which he discovered along the shores of the
Wörthersee and Ossiachersee. On the eastern shore of the latter
he counted no less than 29. These cairns are about 6 feet high,
with a diameter of 15 to 20 feet, and their tops are generally
covered with 4 to 6 feet of water. It will be remembered that
similar cairns were observed in Lake Morat.</p>

<p>The only other place which suggested the existence of
lake-dwellings was the "Laibacher Morast," in which, a few years
previously, a couple of canoes, and some other industrial relics, were
dug out of the peat, the full significance of which only now became
apparent. Since then the vast morass has yielded a large quantity
of the <i>débris</i> of these settlements, which I shall now
proceed to describe.</p>

<h3>LAIBACH MOOR (CARNIOLA).</h3>

<p>What is known as Laibach Moor is an extensive but irregularly
shaped plain now nearly all well cultivated, which extends southwards
from the town of Laibach to Ober-Laibach, some 12 miles
distant. Previous to a series of drainage schemes, executed at
various times during the last fifty years, the whole of this plain
was a morass or peat bog, and there can be no doubt that in
prehistoric times it was a navigable sheet of water. It covers
an area of about 85 English square miles, and is interspersed
here and there with six or seven rocky eminences, which, when
the locality was under water, formed so many islands. It is also
intersected by the rivers Laibach, Isca, and some smaller streams,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
which unite before reaching the town of Laibach, and about
half way up it is crossed by the railway to Trieste. Some years
ago a new road was constructed along the valley of the Isca, from
Laibach to Brunndorf, and in 1875, in the course of excavating
a ditch alongside of it, various bone implements and fragments
of pottery were turned up by the workmen. Mr. Martin Peruzzi,
the proprietor, recognising the archæological value of these objects,
at once gave information of the discovery to the authorities of
the Landesmuseum at Laibach. This led to an extensive series
of investigations, which were continued during the following two
years under the care of Dr. Karl Deschmann, curator of this
museum. An illustrated report of the first year's operations was
published by the eminent archæologist, Baron von Sacken (B. 290),
while those of the two following years have found an able exponent
in Dr. Deschmann. (B. 302 and 317.)</p>

<p>The first year's working revealed the foundations of a pile-dwelling
close to the road on its west side, where, by the removal
of some 3,000 square yards of peat, quite a forest of piles was
disclosed. These were irregularly placed, but on an average they
numbered three or four in a dozen square feet. They were made
of aspen, poplar, elm, and fir, the last, however, being sparingly
used. The peat was about 6 feet thick, and below it was the
ancient sediment of the lake into which the piles were driven,
their heads now merely entering into the peaty stratum. Between
the peat and lake sediment there was a thin layer of organic
<i>débris</i>, 4 or 5 inches thick, in which alone the relics of the
lake-dwellers were found. In the following year some 2,000 square
yards were cleared of peat, partly in the same place, and partly
on the other side of the road. In this new locality the piles
were more closely set and the deposit of peat was a little thicker,
but the character of the relics was exactly the same, only a
larger proportion of the fragments of pottery were ornamented.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Map_8" id="Map_8"></a>
  <img src="images/i_211.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="650" />
</div>

<p class="space-above1">During the autumn of 1877 the site of a
third pile-dwelling was come upon, about 300 yards from the last
mentioned, and on the other side of the Isca (see Sketch, p. 171),
under precisely similar conditions as the two former, but owing to
want of funds the excavations were discontinued before the entire area
was searched. Dr. Deschmann is of opinion that these are by no means
the only portions of the moor in which lake-dwellings existed, as
indications of them were found in several other places along the bed
of the Isca. In further support of this opinion I may mention that in
1857, before lake-dwellings had attracted attention in this quarter,
some objects were found at Moosthal, in quite a different part of
the moor, which point to its being the site of a lake-dwelling. Here
the peat was 10 feet deep, and at this depth, and lying immediately
over the lake-silt, were found three perforated staghorn hammers, two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
canoes, and some other objects of human industry, which, however, were
dispersed before Dr. Deschmann became aware of the discovery.</p>

<p>The relics of human industry collected during these systematic
explorations, with the exception of a few in the Museum of
Vienna, are deposited in the handsome new Museum at Laibach,
where they form a remarkably complete and interesting demonstration
of the culture and civilisation of the lake-dwellers. Some
of these are illustrated on <b><a href="#Fig_42">Figs. 42</a></b>,
<b><a href="#Fig_43">43</a></b>, and <b><a href="#Fig_44">44</a></b>.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Vessels for household use are extremely abundant,
and varied in form and ornamentation. They are all hand-made, and the
quality of the paste appears to have been good&mdash;that for the
larger dishes was mixed with rough sand. All the pottery has a darkish
appearance, but most of the smaller vessels had been smeared over with
some black composition. Not a few of these dishes were quite whole, so
that their varied forms and uses may be readily distinguished. They
may be classified as jars, vases, cups, plates, jugs, bowls, flasks,
spoons, etc.; and ordinary handles, perforated knobs, tubular borings
(<i>ansa canalicularis</i>) appear to have been indiscriminately used.</p>

<p>Some of the smaller dishes have four or five stud-like
processes or rudimentary feet, and others have a pedestal-like
base, slightly expanding at the lowest point, on the underside
of which there is often impressed the shape of a broad cross
(<b><a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a></b>, No. 20). The ornamentation,
when reduced into its simple elements, may be thus stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Straight or wavy ridges, sometimes notched across, and
running upwards or across the body of the vessel; (2) finger
or nail marks; (3) checks made with groups of incised lines
crossing each other; (4) lozenge-shaped spaces alternately plain
and lined; (5) herring-bone pattern; (6) triangles, crosses, wheels,
rhombs, and other simple geometrical figures, sometimes with
inscribed figures or lines; (7) impressions of strings, points,
etc. The style of the more highly ornamented vessels is, though
complicated, artistic, and when the incised lines were filled with
a white material, as is supposed to have been the case with
some of them, these patterns on a dark or black ground must
have been very effective. Ornamentation is not always confined
to the outside of the vessel, as may be seen from <b><a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a></b>,
No. 8. Dr. Deschmann sees a striking resemblance between the Laibach
pottery, both in manufacture and ornamentation, to that represented
in Dr. Schliemann's works on Troy.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Besides the ordinary dishes, there fall to be enumerated under
this heading some two or three hundred spindle-whorls, one or two
cylindrical weights, perforated cones (<b><a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a></b>, No. 5),
a few crucibles of superior workmanship (<b><a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a></b>, No. 14),
a mould for an axe-head (<b><a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a></b>, No. 22), and some other
small objects, apparently toys (<b><a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a></b>, No. 21). Among
the most remarkable and mysterious objects are some ornamented
images, more or less fragmentary, of animals and human beings with
fantastically-formed heads (<b><a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a></b>, Nos. 11, 23,
and 24; and <b>Fig. 195</b>, Nos. 5 to 8).</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;The stone implements, with the exception of
rubbers, hammers, and sharpening-stones, are comparatively
rare. The sharpening-stones are well represented by a variety
of implements&mdash;from the small portable hone with a string
perforation, to a large hollow block weighing 220 pounds. Of simple
stone axes and chisels there are only about a dozen good examples,
but amongst them are two little gems&mdash;one a hatchet of nephrite
(<b><a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a></b>, No. 12), and the other a miniature chisel
of greenstone (No. 9). Perforated axe-hammers number about two dozen
(<b><a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a></b>, No. 10); they are mostly of serpentine
and well shaped, and the boring is neatly executed. The flint objects,
which amount to about four dozen, consist chiefly of neatly-formed
lance-heads; but amongst them are a few scrapers and flakes, but
hardly one that could be called an arrow-point (<b><a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a></b>,
Nos. 1 to 5). Almost unique are two conical anvils, one of which (No. 18) has
metallic particles of copper or bronze on its flat surface. There is
also a polished stone disc showing the commencement of a perforation
near its centre with the core still remaining.</p>

<p><i>Bone and Horn.</i>&mdash;A characteristic feature of the Laibach
settlements is the abundance of implements of bone and horn which they
have yielded, and which may be thus classified:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Perforated hammer-axes of staghorn, numbering between 300 and
400, in all stages of manufacture. The most typical forms of these
implements are sketched on <b><a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a></b>.</p>

<p>2. Polished daggers, pointers, chisels, etc., varying in length
from 4 to 10 inches, amount to many hundreds. The smaller pointers,
awls, and pins, were made of bone splinters and ground to fine points.
The finer daggers were invariably made of the leg-bones of a deer or
other animal. It appears that they were manufactured by sawing or
cutting the bone lengthways and slightly diagonally, so as to have two
weapons out of the one bone, leaving each with a joint for its hilt.
One or two bones were found showing this operation in an uncompleted
stage. Some of these daggers had perforations near the extremity of
the handle-end for suspension.

<p>3. The tynes of deer-horns were converted into coarse needles
(<b><a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a></b>, No. 13), and used probably in the
manufacture of nets. Over a score of these implements have been collected.</p>

<p>4. A few finely-polished objects like hooks are supposed to have
been used as dress-fasteners or buckles (Nos. 6 and 16).</p>

<p>5. Another set of curious objects (No. 7), of which about a score
have been collected, is supposed by Dr. Deschmann to have been used
as artificial bait to catch large fish, just as we at the present day
use an imitation minnow. They are made of the tynes of deer-horns, and
vary in length from 2 to 5 inches.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>6. About a dozen or so of very sharp and finely-polished needles
made from the superficial lamina of a rib. The eye, which is at one
end, is either round or elongated (No. 15.)</p>

<p>7. Several hollow bones (some of the wild swan), open at both ends,
and varying in length from 5 to 10 inches, have marks inside, as if
made by the friction of running threads. They are supposed to have
been used in the preparation of thread, and hence go under the name of
"Zwirndreher."</p>

<p>8. Some flat portions of the horns of the elk and the underjaws of
oxen, minus their teeth, were used as polishers.</p>

<p><i>Metal Objects.</i>&mdash;(<b><a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a></b>.) The total
number of metal objects now in the Museum at Laibach, and tabulated as coming
from the lake-dwellings, is 24. They are all either of bronze or copper, as
hitherto not a trace of iron has anywhere been met with. The following
is a list of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Two flat-handled bronze swords 21 and 14&frac12; inches long
(Nos. 3 and 4).</p>

<p>2. Three bronze daggers, 11&frac12;, 8, and 7&frac12;, inches long
(Nos. 2, 1, and 7). The larger has four rivets for fastening a handle;
the next has six rivets, and the blade is beautifully ornamented; and
the third has two rivet-holes, arranged differently from those in the
other two.</p>

<p>3. A winged bronze celt (No. 5); and one of the flat type
(No. 9), said to be of copper.</p>

<p>4. Portions of three bronze pins (Nos. 12 and 13).</p>

<p>5. Two thin bracelets of bronze, much worn.</p>

<p>6. Five peculiar objects of copper, like awls (Nos. 6 and 8).</p>

<p>7. Seven objects like daggers, lance-heads, or knives, rudely
hammered, are also supposed to be of pure copper (Nos. 10 and 11).</p>

<p>The winged celt and the larger of the two swords are not noticed in
either of the reports of the various investigations, but I am assured
they form part of the same find; and, in corroboration of this, I find
they are included in a photograph issued by the authorities of the
Museum, purporting to be a representation of all the metal objects from the Pfahlbauten.

<p><i>Objects of Wood.</i>&mdash;A canoe 15&frac12; feet long and 2&frac12;
feet wide was pointed at both ends. Also a toy canoe. Fragments of
a few dishes, such as a large plate, a spoon of yew wood, and some
bowls&mdash;one of which is scooped out of a large round natural
protuberance of a tree. A few elongated pebbles rolled in birch bark.
Portions of bast ropes, and some coils of very fine carbonised linen threads.

<p>Two remarkable machines ("Biberfälle") (<b><a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a></b>),
each constructed out of one solid piece of wood, and having two movable
valves in the centre worked by projecting pivots resting loosely in
corresponding holes in the machine. These valves are freely movable
when pushed upwards, but this motion is arrested just a little short
of the perpendicular by the slanting shape of their posterior edges,
so that, when left to themselves, they always fall together, and never
backwards. The one here represented is in a very perfect state of
preservation; and the other, though now in a fragmentary condition,
clearly shows that in its structure it was precisely similar to
the former. These peculiar implements, though found at a little
distance, are considered of contemporary date with the lake-dwelling
remains, as they were in the same archæological stratum, and about
the same depth in the peat. The one here figured is made of oak,
and measures 32 inches long, 12 inches broad, and 4 inches deep.
The aperture, when the valves are open, measures 9 by 5 inches. The
most recent opinion as to the use of these machines is that they
were beaver traps&mdash;an opinion that derives much probability
from the extraordinary number of the skeletons of this animal which
have been found among the food-refuse of the inhabitants of this lake-dwelling.</p>

Wooden machine, supposed to be a Beaver-trap.</p>
</div>

<p>Such machines are not absolutely new to archæology, and the
little that is known about them rather strengthens the opinion
above given as to their use. The first discovered to which
attention was directed in archæological journals was figured and
described in 1873<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
by Dr. Hildebrandt, of Tribsees, Neu-Vorpommern. It measures
29&frac12; inches long, and 6 inches broad at the ends, and has two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
movable valves in the centre. It was found in a peat bog at a depth of
5 to 6 feet below the surface, and is now preserved in the Museum at
Greifswald. Dr. Hildebrandt conjectured that it was some kind of trap
for catching fish.</p>

<p>In reply to Dr. Hildebrandt's notice of the machine found
at Tribsees, Professor F. Merkel, of Rostock, wrote to say<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
that two similar ones were found in different parts of North Germany,
which he considered to be otter traps rather than fish traps.
One of them was found in the moor of Samow, near Gnoien, at
a depth of 6 or 7 feet, and is now in the Museum at Rostock.</p>

  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 47</b>.&mdash;Wooden machine,

</div>

<p>It is remarkably like the one from Laibach, and differs only in
being 4 inches longer, and having three holes in the valves instead
of two (<b><a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a></b>). A third<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
was found in a moor at Friedrichsbruch, near Flatow, in the province
of West Preussen, which was sent to the Märkisches Museum. At no time
within historical times were such machines known to be in use, so that
their function still remains conjectural, unless the circumstantial
evidence derived from the Pfahlbau at Laibach decides them to be "Biberfälle."</p>

<p>While the proofs of the above remarks were still in my
hands, I received from Dr. Luigi Meschinelli, of the Geological
Museum of the Royal University of Naples, a copy of an article
by him, entitled "Studio Sugli Avanzi Preistorici della Valle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
di Fontega."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
The objects described in this memoir were found, in the course of
excavating peat, in a small valley which opens into Lake Fimon in
the vicinity of Vicenza. Among numerous industrial remains of man,
consisting of fragments of pottery, various implements of stone and
flint, a bronze celt, and a Roman coin of the time of the Emperor
Adrian, were three curious and novel objects of wood shaped like small
canoes. One of these machines&mdash;the best preserved, though not the
largest&mdash;is carefully described and figured by Dr. Meschinelli,
and from his minute description there can be no doubt it is another
example of the same apparatus which I have just described as having
been found in North Germany and Laibach Moor.</p>

  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 47</b><i>a</i>.&mdash;Wooden machine from
<span class="smcap">Fontega</span>, 28 inches long, with detached
valves, and some worked sticks found along with it.</p>
</div>

<p>The body of the Italian machine was constructed out of one piece
of oak, and measured 28 inches long, 6&frac34; inches broad, and
2&frac34; inches thick (<a href="#Fig_47_a"><b>Fig. 47</b><i>a</i></a>).
The opening in the centre, which was closed by two valves revolving on projecting
pivots, and resting along their axis in a deep groove cut on each side of the
machine, measured 6&frac12; inches by 3&frac12; inches on the under
side, so that this would be the actual size of the aperture when the
valves were open. Associated with the machine, as will be seen from
the illustration, were several worked portions of sticks, evidently
the <i>débris</i> of some kind of mechanism attached to it. Similar sticks
were found along with the Laibach examples. It will be observed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the dimensions of the Italian one are a little less than those of the
previously described machines, but that in all other respects they
are identical. The other two found at Fontega were, according to Dr.
Meschinelli, precisely similar to the one he describes.</p>

<p>Among the organic remains from these peat excavations I find no
mention made of the osseous remains of the beaver, neither is this
animal included by Lioy among the fauna of the lake-dwellings at
Fimon. So far, therefore, there is no presumptive evidence that the
machines described by Dr. Meschinelli were <i>beaver-traps</i>. That,
however, the beaver frequented the Po valley during prehistoric times
we have positive evidence in the discovery of its bones in several
localities&mdash;as, for example, the terremare of Castellaccio (B.
457) and Cogozzo (B. 389a).</p>

<p>Puzzled to account for these curious machines which so fortunately
attracted the attention of Dr. Meschinelli, he concludes his notice of
them thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"A che cosa poteva servire questo oggetto? Era forse un modello per
costruire poi una piroga di dimensioni maggiori per utilità pratica?
Portata a queste dimensioni, serviva essa al trasporto, o meglio
quei congegni erano stati inventati a facilitare la pesca? Volle
invece l'artefice sbizzarrire il suo genio inventivo nel costruire un
trastullo cosi grazioso? E perchè allora costruirne due di eguali?"</p>

<p>It may be interesting to add that in 1859 a wooden machine, which
evidently comes under the same category as the above, was found in
a bog in the townland of Coolnaman, parish of Aghadowey, county
Derry, Ireland. It is figured in <i>The Ulster Journal of Archæology</i>
(vol. vii. p. 165), as an "antique wooden implement," which is thus
described by the editor:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"It was discovered embedded in a solid bank of turf, at a depth of 4
feet from the surface, the bog extending to a great depth underneath.
No other article was found near it. It is entirely of wood, and
measures as follows:&mdash;Extreme length, 3 feet 5 inches; breadth
across the centre, 7&frac12; inches; depth, 2&frac12; inches; lid, 14
inches long and 3&frac12; inches broad; under hole, 12&frac34; inches
long and 3&frac12; inches broad. The upper edges have evidently been
higher on all sides, when perfect&mdash;probably on a level with
the lid or small door&mdash;or even extending still higher, so as
to form a kind of trough. The lid is now somewhat narrower than the
opening which it is intended to close, but, no doubt, was made to fit
accurately when in use. It moves up and down on a hinge formed by two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
projections which lie in corresponding hollows, and seems to have
been opened and shut by means of a handle inserted into a hole in
its centre. These hinges have, no doubt, been kept in their place by
some part of the wood above them which is now lost. From each end of
the lid and on a level with its upper surface there runs a hollow
groove, sloping regularly downwards to the end of the implement, and
terminating in a hole which perforates the bottom, seemingly for the
discharge of a liquid. Towards each end are two lateral holes placed
opposite to each other, one in each lip of the groove, apparently to
receive a rope passed through them to serve as a handle for removing
the article from place to place. The under side of the implement is
flat, having in its centre an oblong hole (the bottom opening of
the cavity covered by the lid), which has all its four edges sloped
or bevelled.... Coolnaman, which gives name to the townland, is a
considerable hill, entirely cultivated, but surrounded at its base
by a bog of unknown depth, which evidently occupies the site of
an ancient lake. On the side of the hill where the implement was
discovered the turf has become quite solidified, and forms a dense
black mass up to the surface."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 47</b><i>b</i>.&mdash;Antique wooden
implement from Ireland, showing upper and under surfaces. Length, 3 feet 5 inches.</p>
</div>

<p>In looking at <a href="#Fig_47_b"><b>Fig. 47</b><i>b</i></a>, which shows the
upper and under sides of this implement, it will be at once seen that it differs
from the Continental examples only by having one valve or lid closing the
central aperture instead of two. Neither the editor nor any of the
parties who had examined this curious machine at the time had ever
seen anything of the kind before, and no rational explanation of
its use has ever since been offered. One thought it was a fishtrap
intended to be placed in a river; another, that it was a kind of pump;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
a third, that it was a machine for making peats; and a fourth, that it
was a cheese-press (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 289).</p>

<p>To find so many of these machines, of unknown use and so
remarkably similar in structure, in such widely separate districts
as Ireland, North Germany, Styria, and Italy, must be a matter
of interest to archæologists, and no one can say that the correct
explanation of their use is to be found in any of the suggestions
hitherto offered on this point. I may mention one element
which may help in the solution of this problem, viz. that all
the examples from Italy, Laibach, and Ireland were found in
bogs that were formerly lakes. Perhaps this is true in regard
to those from North Germany, but the point is not referred to
in the short notices which have appeared of them. If these
machines are really traps they could only be used in water
where the animal could insert its head from below, and among
amphibious animals the <i>otter</i> and <i>beaver</i> are the only ones to
which all the conditions involved in the trap theory could apply.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Some of these bones contained crystals of vivianite, resembling
in this respect the osseous remains found on some of the Scottish
crannogs, especially that at Lochlee. (B. 373, p. 88.)</p>

<p>The <i>Bos primigenius</i> is also represented by a portion of
horn 21 inches long. The presence of hazel nuts with gnawed holes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
also points to the existence of some small rodents, probably the
dormouse. One or two bones (metacarpal bone of a deer and an ulna of
the bear) are covered all over with groups of peculiarly-striated
markings, as if made with a file; but for what purpose, or whether the
work of man or of some rodent animal, remains a mystery.</p>

<p>There is also a considerable quantity of the bones of birds,
the spine bones of fish, jawbones of large pike, carp, etc.,
and a portion of the shell of a tortoise (<i>Emis lutaria</i>).</p>

<p>Of human remains there are two skulls of adults, minus the
facial part, another of a child, a lower jaw, and a few bones
of the extremities.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a minute search, no traces of any kind of corn
have hitherto come to light; but we must not therefore conclude that
the lake-dwellers were ignorant of agriculture and the ordinary
cereals, as grain is so apt to decompose unless it happens to be in
a carbonised state. It is, however, probable that the cultivation
of grain was not the chief industry of the colony, and that the
mealing-stones which were in such abundance must have been used
for grinding some other kind of food as well as grain, such as the
kernels of hazel-nuts and water-chestnuts. The water-chestnut (<i>Trapa
natans</i>), according to Deschmann, does not grow at the present time in
Carniola; nor has it ever, since the earliest botanical examination of
the country by Scopoli, been considered a native plant in the <i>Flora
Carniolica</i>. In the last century the monks of the Cistercian order,
at Sittich, cultivated it in their ponds. Pliny, however, distinctly
states that in ancient times it was used as a food. "Thraces qui ad
Strymona habitant foliis tribuli equos saginant, ipsi nucleo vivunt,
panem facientes prædulcem, et qui contrabit ventrem." (H. Nat., xxii. 10-12.)</p>

<p>Among the vast quantity of osseous remains there is not a
single fragment of the skeleton of the horse. On the other hand,
it is calculated that the deer is represented by no less than 500
individuals, and the beaver by at least 140. For the latter this
is a colossal figure, seeing that the richest station in beaver
remains among the Swiss lake-dwellings, viz. Moosseedorfsee, numbers
only eight individuals. The animal is now extinct in the country,
nor has it ever been mentioned in any of the historical annals of Carniola.

<h2>Third Lecture.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">LAKE-DWELLINGS AND PILE-STRUCTURES IN ITALY.</span></h2>

<p>On the 20th of July, 1860, M. G. de Mortillet wrote a letter to
Sig. Cornalia, president of the Italian Society of the Natural
Sciences, at Milan,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
in which, while mentioning the discoveries made in Switzerland, he
suggested that similar antiquities might be found in the lakes of
Lombardy. The reading of this letter led to a discussion which at
once elicited one or two statements of archæological importance. The
vice-president, Sig. Antonio Villa, recalled the fact that a bronze
axe-head and some flint arrow-heads were found in the turf-bog of
Bosisio, at a depth of 10 feet, which were described and figured in a
Milan journal, <i>Il Fotografo</i>, 2nd August, 1856. The president also
mentioned that he possessed weapons of a similar character, which
were found, along with some human bones, in the peat-beds of Brenna.
Shortly afterwards the celebrated naturalist Gastaldi, in an article
in <i>Il Nuovo Cimento</i>, directed attention to certain antiquities
which the turf-cutters were in the habit of finding in the "torbiera
di Mercurago." (B. 37.) Subsequently Gastaldi visited this locality,
and along with Professor Moro, of Arona (who first recognised the
importance of the objects in question), made further researches in
the peat at Mercurago, the result of which was to leave no doubt that
they had here to deal with the remains of a true palafitte analogous
to the pile-dwellings in the Swiss lakes. During the next two years
Gastaldi's report was considerably enlarged by further finds at
Mercurago. (B. 43 and 52.)</p>

<p>About the same time that these discoveries at Mercurago
were being made the existence of a palafitte in Lake Garda
was surmised from the finding, at various times, of bronze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
implements and weapons in the harbour at Peschiera; but nothing
further of a very definite character occurred till the summer of 1863,
when Professors Desor and De Mortillet visited Lombardy in search of
lake-dwellings. These eminent archæologists were joined by Professor
Stoppani, and the immediate result of their investigations was the
discovery of several settlements in the Lake of Varese and elsewhere.
(B. 67.) Since then the lacustrine stations south of the Alps have
greatly increased in number, there being now scarcely any of the
smaller lakes and turbaries of North Italy that have not yielded more
or fewer remains of this character.</p>

<p>In addition to these ordinary lake-dwellings, whether in water or
in peat, there are, in the valley of the Po, other ancient remains
known as "Terremare," which are now shown to be so closely analogous
to the former that they fall to be described as land palafittes. They
are found only in the eastern part of the valley, and as some of their
relics, in common with those of the adjacent palafittes, present some
characteristics which are not found in western Lombardy, I fasten on
this distinction as a convenient principle of classifying the lake
and peat dwellings into a western and an eastern group, reserving the
"terremare" for separate treatment. Accordingly we begin with Lake
Varese, whose settlements appear to have been the most important and
the most central in the western group.</p>

<h3>LAKE OF VARESE.</h3>

<p>Lake Varese is irregularly shaped, about 5&frac12; miles in length,
and less than half that in breadth. It occupies a somewhat shallow
basin, its greatest depth being 85 feet, and, although bounded on
the north by high hills, its banks are generally flat or shelving.
Its surface is 770 feet above sea-level, and 134 feet above that of
Lake Maggiore, to which its surplus water is carried by the Bardello,
a stream which has its outlet at the north end of the lake. The
district around is rich and well cultivated, except on the south
side, where the lake becomes contiguous with an extensive peat-bog
called "torbiera della Brabbia." When Stoppani and his illustrious
friends, along with Desor's experienced fisher, Benz, commenced their
lacustrine explorations in Lombardy, they selected Lake Varese to
start with, on account of the suitability of its shores for such
structures. On the very first day (21st April, 1863) their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
labours were rewarded by the discovery of the sites of two settlements&mdash;one
at the south-east side of the little island then called
Isolino, or Isola Camilla, but now I. Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and the other opposite the village of Bodio.</p>

<p>Professor Stoppani continued his researches after the departure of
his friends, and made further discoveries, not only in Lake Varese,
but in some of the other lakes of Lombardy. In November of the same
year Captain Angelo Angelucci, of Turin, was attracted to the scene
of these discoveries in Lake Varese, and henceforth took an active
part in the investigation of its palafittes. (B. 63.) Nor must I omit
to mention the Abate Ranchet among the list of the early explorers.
He discovered in the same year not only a new station on the south
side of the outlet, but also, in the following year, two others in
the adjoining lake of Monate. (B. 85.) At the end of the first year's
explorations we find, from the reports of Stoppani and Angelucci,
that no less than six stations were determined in Lake Varese, all
situated on its south-western shore. In 1868, when Dr. Camillo
Marinoni published a report on "Le abitazioni lacustri e gli avanzi di
umana industria in Lombardia" (B. 159), the number had increased to
seven. Although no addition has since been made to their number, much
attention has been given, especially in these later years, to their
investigation. The Sketch Map of Lake Varese (<a href="#Map_9">page 189</a>)
shows the names and the respective positions of these settlements,
which I shall now shortly describe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isola Virginia.</span>&mdash;This is a small
egg-shaped island lying along the west shore, from which it is distant
about 80 yards. It is 240 yards long, with a maximum breadth of 100
yards, and contains besides some fine trees, a house with two storeys,
the upper of which is converted into an archæological museum, and at
a little distance there is a café for the convenience of the numerous
visitors that frequent the locality. Its area is nearly 3 acres, and
its highest point is barely 8 feet above the average level of the lake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p class="space-above1">Piles were discovered in the lake at the
south-east side of the island, in a space extending along its margin
for about 100 yards, and about half that distance in breadth. Two
years ago, when I visited the locality, the heads of piles were
readily seen through the water, just cropping above the sandy bottom.
In some cases it was difficult to distinguish them from stones; but a
poke with the oar or a long stick at once determined which they were.
Professor Stoppani, in his first report (B. 67), describes this as a
steinberg, but the idea of the whole island being artificial&mdash;an
idea first suggested by Desor, who found analogous instances in
the Rosen Insel, Lake Starnberg, in the little island at Inkwyl,
and in the Irish Crannogs&mdash;gained strength by the discovery
of similar stumps of piles on its north-west side. Although the
local antiquaries&mdash;Ranchet, Regazzoni, Quaglia, Castelfranco,
and others&mdash;occasionally visited these lacustrine stations
and made considerable investigations, with the result of adding to
their private collections, it was not till 1878 that any systematic
researches were made with the view of testing Desor's suggestion that
the island was a gigantic crannog. This was first attempted by an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Englishman, Mr. W. K. Foster, of London, who happened to be residing
in the neighbourhood. In carrying out the necessary excavations
he had the assistance of Ranchet and Regazzoni, both experienced
investigators of lacustrine antiquities. Five trenches, covering on
the aggregate about 80 square yards, were dug in different parts of
the island, and in all these, piles, fragments of pottery (one of
which had the impression of plaited reed-work), and various other
relics of human industry, were encountered. In the sections presented
by these trenches the following strata were successively passed
through:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>The most noteworthy objects collected in these operations were as
follows:&mdash;In the first layer a Roman coin of Marcus Aurelius,
and a portion of a mould for a socketed lance-head (<b><a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a></b>,
No. 19). In the second, two fragments of bronze. In the third, two
polished stone celts, with a portion of a third, and two clay weights.
In the fourth, a flint saw with a wooden handle, two bone pins, and
some sharpening-stones.</p>

<p>The piles were evidently in their natural position, and the
conclusion that the entire island had been a pile-dwelling was
irresistible; but the questions when and by what means was the
transformation accomplished, were as obscure as before. Mainly for the
purpose of clearing this matter, Sig. Ettore Ponti, in September of
the following year, gave instructions to have further excavations made
in different parts of the island. On this occasion 12 trenches were
dug, covering an area of about 230 square yards with an average depth
of 3 to 4 feet.</p>

<p>The stratification and composition of the stuff were very similar
to those experienced in the former excavations. In this space 440
piles were counted, and Regazzoni calculates that at this rate the
original number of piles requisite for the construction of the entire
lake-village would be from 35,000 to 40,000. Some horizontal beams
were also found among the <i>débris</i>. Among the relics the following
are noteworthy:&mdash;A tyne of deer's horn, with a flint implement
inserted into the end of it (No. 3); a small clay weight shaped
like a pear; several objects of worked bone, as needles (Nos. 7 to
9), pointers, chisels (No. 25), handles, etc. A knife (No. 5) and a
dagger of bronze (No. 6), and two oblong beads of coloured glass with
transverse grooves, were found in the stratum immediately below the surface soil.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
As a rule, the tops of the piles in these trenches were on a level
with the surface of the water, while those in the lake were several
feet lower&mdash;more or less, according to the depth of water. The
cause of this was no doubt the protection given to the former by
the accumulation of <i>débris</i> around them. It was observed that the
uppermost layer alone had yielded Roman coins, but along with them
were objects of both the Stone and Bronze Ages&mdash;a juxtaposition
which might be accounted for by agricultural and other operations to
which the island has been subjected in historical times. The fourth,
or that which lay immediately over the ancient lake-sediment, was
alone exclusively deposited under water, as it contained some entire
dishes, and the associated <i>débris</i> were just the usual contents
of lake-dwelling relic-beds, viz. the shells of hazel-nuts, acorns,
charred bits of wood, bones of various animals (among others the skull
of an enormous wild boar), as well as implements of bone, horn, and
flint, pottery, etc. The second and third layers were composed of
much the same materials as the fourth, but they appeared to have been
the contents of a previously-deposited relic-bed artificially heaped
up, as they contained portions of wooden beams which had no definite
purpose, but lay in the soil in all directions.</p>

<p>The relics of humanity collected on the Isola Virginia in the
course of these various excavations are so numerous that one of the
two rooms set apart by Sig. Ponti as an archæological museum for
the lacustrine remains of Lake Varese is entirely devoted to their
exhibition and preservation, where they have been carefully and neatly
arranged under the skilful care of Professor Regazzoni.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;As in the other lacustrine stations in this lake,
there are two kinds of pottery&mdash;one black, and made of fine paste,
of which most of the smaller vessels were made; the other is of
a greyish colour, but sometimes it has a reddish tinge, and contains
a mixture of fine gravel or coarse sand, which gives it a rough
appearance. The fragments and entire dishes in the Ponti Museum
decidedly testify to considerable skill in the ceramic art. Besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
perforated knobs and tubular borings for the insertion of cords
(No. 17), there are various forms of handles, as in Nos. 14 and
16, the latter of which is interesting, as it suggests the primary
stage of the <i>ansa lunata</i> which is such a prominent characteristic
of the pottery in the eastern portion of the Po valley.</p>

<p>The diversity of ornamentation is also worthy of
notice&mdash;raised dots, nail-marks, perforated rims, lines,
corrugated grooves, and cord-markings, forming a variety of
combinations (Nos. 13, 15, 22, 23, 26, and 27). One bit shows the
impression of plaited reed-work (No. 29). Another, an entire dish
made of fine black paste, is a curiosity in its way; it consists
of three cups united, and having a communication with each other
by a small hole in the dividing septa (No. 24). The coarse pottery
indicates vessels of large dimensions. There are also loom-weights,
spindle-whorls (No. 21), some conical objects pierced vertically (No.
10), and casts of wicker-work, supposed to be the remains of the
cottage walls.</p>

<p><i>Bone and Horn.</i>&mdash;Objects of this class are numerous, as
polished daggers, pointers, chisels (No. 25), needles (Nos. 7 to 9);
also a few perforated teeth.</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Celts and chisels are fairly abundant, and among
them are one or two of jade. Though I noted only one fragment of a
perforated axe-head, the art of boring stone was known and skilfully
practised, as there are several spindle-whorls and other implements
with neat perforations (No. 18). There are also hammer-stones (some
with finger-marks), corn-grinders, and polishers. Among the latter are
large flat polishing slabs, and a few hand-polishers made like a stone
celt (No. 11), which are peculiar to North Italy, if not, indeed, to
the Varese lake-dwellers, as I have seen only one other out of the
district, viz. at Viadana.</p>

<p>Among the flint objects are knives, scrapers, saws, arrow-points,
chisels (like those in <b><a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a></b>, Nos. 8, 14, and 15),
cores, and a large quantity of flakes (Nos. 1 to 3). For small cutting implements
flint was not the only substance used by these lake-dwellers, as
there are 36 fine flakes of obsidian (No. 4), and some arrow-heads
of rock crystal.</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;The bronze objects in the museum, including fragments,
amount only to 15, and represent knives, fish-hooks, etc. (Nos. 5, 6, and 12).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Amber.</i>&mdash;There is also a bit of amber which appears to have
been an ornament.</p>

<p>Small square or oblong pieces of wood perforated (No. 20)
are supposed to have been floats for nets.</p>

<p>The organic remains collected in the fourth stratum, which
was considered to be the true relic-bed of the palafitte, were
submitted to Professor Sordelli, who recognised, among other
seeds and fruits, the following:&mdash;Millet (<i>Panicum miliaceum</i>),
wheat (<i>Trit. vulgare</i>), bramble (<i>R. fruticosus</i>), and the
vine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>).</p>

<p>Among the bones of animals identified were those of the bear,
wolf, badger, beaver, wild boar, stag, roe, etc. The ordinary
domestic animals were also represented, and in addition to them
I have to mention portions of two human jaws which were found
a few inches below the tops of the piles. (B. 324, 326, 341, 343a,
359, and 437.)</p>

<p>Professor Castelfranco (B. 456), who has carefully studied the
phenomena presented by these repeated excavations, formulates
the following theory as to the succession of events which have
brought about the evolution, so to speak, of the Isola Virginia:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The original palafitte had been destroyed by a conflagration
towards the close of the Bronze Age or the beginning of the
Iron Age.</p>

<p>(2) Its inhabitants were hunters, fishers, rearers of domestic
animals, and agriculturists.</p>

<p>(3) Shortly after the destruction of the pile-village,
its subsequent occupiers converted the larger portion of its
site&mdash;which had already, in parts at least, reached the surface
by the gradual accumulation of <i>débris</i>&mdash;into a veritable island,
by heaping over it stuff dug from the margin and especially from the
landward side, where there is now a channel separating the island
from the mainland. Thus the upper layers contain the <i>débris</i> of
the earlier people, mixed with sand, gravel, and mud. This view is
rendered probable by the fact that in one place, towards the north
of the island, the second layer was displaced by an artificially
constructed bed of large pebbles.</p>

<p>(4) The newcomers, to whom Castelfranco assigns the transformation
of the palafitte into an island, were the Ligurians, whose
"sépultures à cineration" are so numerously found in the neighbourhood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bodio.</span>&mdash;The bay opposite this
village contains the remains of three stations, the most southerly
of which is known as "Keller" or "Del Gaggio," the next as "Bodio
Centrale" or "Delle Monete," and the third as "Desor" or "Del
Moresco." All these are comparatively near the shore, being only about
30 yards distant, and the central one is about equidistant&mdash;some
800 yards&mdash;from the other two. (B. 327, p. 47.) The central
station appears to have been a true steinberg, as its area was covered
with stones; regarding which Stoppani remarks that formerly they were
more numerous, because within recent times some were known to have
been removed for building purposes. At first more bronze objects
were found on Keller, and more pottery on Desor, while the Centrale
was characterised by the discovery on it of a hoard of Roman coins.
Subsequent investigations have not borne out these early distinctions
based on the character of their relics, and they are now generally
acknowledged to belong to the same age.</p>

<p>The coins found on the Centrale were mostly small silver pieces,
much decomposed, belonging to the last half-century of the Republic.
Stoppani collected about 70, and Angelucci, who explored shortly
after him, no less than 128. One found by Regazzoni in 1876 (B.
327, p. 52) has on it, along with the head of Mark Antony, the
following legend:&mdash;<span class="smcap">M. ANT. IMP. AUG. III.
VIR. R.P.C. M. BARBAT. Q.P.</span>, etc., which would make the date
about 40 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The hoard is supposed to
have been lost or deposited here long after the lake-dwelling ceased
to be inhabited&mdash;a supposition that is borne out by the fact
that the coins were confined to one limited spot, only a couple of
yards square. In 1876-7 Sig. Ponti made researches on Desor which
greatly enriched his museum both in stone and bronze objects. (B.
327.) A selection of objects from these stations is
given on <b><a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a></b>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cazzago-Brabbia.</span>&mdash;This station
is situated opposite the village of the same name, and at first it
gave such poor results that Stoppani called it a trial station, or
an attempt to found a settlement. From the researches made in 1877
it was found to be rich in remains, and exactly similar to those at
Bodio. It was, however, farther from the shore, and extended parallel
to it for about 150 yards. Its breadth was somewhat irregular, and,
judging from the disposition of its piles, it would appear to have
been two quadrangularly-shaped stations nearly in contact with
each other. Among the bronze objects collected on this station are
four lance-heads, a chisel, an awl, 10 fish-hooks, four hair-pins,
a fibula, etc. (B. 456.) There are also some fine arrow-points of flint.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Bardello.</span>&mdash;Near the mouth of the
river are two stations, one on the left and the other on the right
shore. The former, called Ranchet, after its discoverer, is a small
settlement some 200 yards from the mouth of the river, and 6 or 7
from the shore. It measures about 60 yards long and 50 broad. A large
quantity of the bones of domestic animals was found here, as well
as some flint and bone arrow-points, spindle-whorls, and various
fragments of pottery. Ranchet records also a small lance-head of
bronze, a portion of a vase containing some black stuff adhering
to it (supposed to be remains of food), and portions of another
of fine black paste. The station on the north shore, called after
Professor Stoppani, by Regazzoni, is about 100 yards from the mouth
of the Bardello, in the direction of Gavirate. It is in the form of a
parallelogram, 65 by 45 yards, and, like the previous station, has the
piles arranged in parallel rows. Among its relics are:&mdash;Bones of
the ox, goat, stag, and pig; flint arrow-heads, scrapers, etc., of the
usual kind; some bone implements. Two bronze pins and a winged celt
are sufficient to show that the station was similar to the others in
Lake Varese (Nos. 23 and 44).</p>

<p>Marinoni (B. 159) mentions another station opposite Gavirate,
but neither Regazzoni nor Ranchet could find any traces of it.
(B. 327, p. 66.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Torbiera di Biandrono.</span>&mdash;Lake
Biandrono, which formerly occupied a larger area than at present, has
on its north-west side an extensive peat-bog, in which Dr. B. Quaglia
has discovered the remains of a true palafitte lying under a deposit
of about 6 feet of moss. The station is some 200 yards distant from
the lake, and of a quadrangular shape, with massive piles scattered
over its area. It is remarkable as having supplied objects which might
be considered characteristic of all periods&mdash;from the earliest
polished Stone Age down to that in which knives, spears, hooks, and
spurs of iron were manufactured. (B. 327, p. 89.) Other objects
recorded from this station are polished stone hatchets; arrow and
lance-heads of yellow and dark flint; fragments of pottery, some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
which were made of fine paste by the aid of the potter's wheel, and
had extremely elegant forms (B. 423, p. 86); two fish-hooks of bone
and two oars now in the Museum at Varese. Four curious objects similar
to one from Torbiera di Cazzago-Brabbia (<b><a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a></b>,
No. 18) were found here. (B. 327, p. 87.) These relics have been widely dispersed,
some having gone to the Museums of Pavia, Milan, Varese, and Como. An
iron spur figured by Regazzoni is in the Como Museum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Torbiera della Brabbia.</span>&mdash;Some forty
years ago the peasants commenced to cut peats in the extensive turbary
which lies on both sides of the canal Brabbia, and it is recorded that
objects of antiquity were from time to time found, to which, however,
little attention was paid. As early as 1856, Angelo Quaglia directed
attention to worked beams in the peat, and since 1863, when such
objects began to be more inquired after, other piles were detected
in one or two places. The most important of these stations is near
the mouth of the Brabbia, on its east bank. Here, during the last few
years, many interesting relics have been found. While the usual flint
and stone objects (Nos. 2 to 8) are abundant, several others of a more
novel character have to be added to the list. Especially noteworthy
are some peculiarly-shaped fibulæ (Nos. 9 to 15), one being of iron
(No. 12); and a curious object made of bronze rings (No. 18), supposed
to be an epaulette, is also from this station. Other objects of bronze
are some hair-pins (Nos. 22 to 28), an ornamental pendant (No. 17),
a winged celt (No. 21), and a ring (No. 19). There is also one flat
celt of copper (No. 20). Among the stone celts and chisels some are
now recognised to be of jade. (B. 423, p. 80.) No. 33 represents a
hatchet of chloromelanite. Quaglia figures a curious flat stone like a
wheel, with a wide circular perforation, and brought to a sharp edge
along its outer margin. There were also spindle-whorls of terra-cotta
(No. 29) and a quantity of pottery (Nos. 34 and 35); also two small
pendants of amber. Of staghorn there are two magnificent harpoons, one
of which is here figured (No. 32). Square bits of wood with central
perforations (No. 36) are supposed to have been used as floats for
fishing-nets. Among the osseous remains is the skull of a deer with
part of the horns attached.

<span class="smcap">Pustenga.</span>&mdash;Between Galliate and
Doverio, and not very far from the south shore of Lake Varese, there
exists in the plain called "Pustenga" a turbary of some 17 acres in
extent, which was formerly a small lake, and in which G. Quaglia
(B. 423, p. 90) has detected the remains of a palafitte. Among the
objects recorded from this station are two arrow-points, a knife and
a saw of flint, six stone celts, and a large jaw of an ox. Of the
stone hatchets four are of serpentine, one of jadeite (?), and one of
chloromelanite. The latter is figured by Quaglia. (B. 423, Pl. iv. 45.)</p>

<h3>LAKE MONATE.</h3>

<p>In the month of April, 1863, Stoppani, Desor, and De Mortillet
searched this lake unsuccessfully, and consequently came to the
conclusion that it was unsuitable for lake-dwellings ("non potesse
offrire piaggia opportuna per le palafitte"). Notwithstanding this
opinion, the Abate Ranchet, with the assistance of two local
fishermen, succeeded shortly afterwards in discovering the sites of
two settlements on the east shore of the lake, near the village of
Cadrezzate. (B. 159.) The stations were in water from 6 to 9
feet deep, and about 200 yards apart, and their sites were marked
by large mounds of stones ("enormi cumuli di grossi ciottoli").
Fragments of pottery were found in abundance, which in quality of
paste and form corresponded with those of the palafittes in Lake
Varese. One dish had also a quantity of black stuff, which was
supposed to have been the remains of some kind of porridge. A
saw, two arrow-points, and a few chips, of flint, and bits of charcoal,
were the only objects, in addition to the pottery, collected.</p>

<p>Little was done by way of exploring these stations till the
year 1875, when the brothers Borghi, the proprietors of the lake,
became interested in its submerged antiquities, and proposed to
make further researches. To the experienced archæologist Castelfranco
they entrusted the conduct of these researches, and it is
to his report I am indebted for the following facts. (B. 321.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sabione.</span>&mdash;The most northerly and
largest of the two stations at Cadrezzate is about 60 yards from
the shore, and occupies a quadrangular space of about 100 yards in
length, and rather more than the half of this in breadth. This area
was overspread with stony mounds having intervals of from two to four
yards between, and for this reason it was difficult to operate with
the drag. Piles were found in the intervals between, as well as on,
these steinbergs; but Castelfranco thinks the former were the roadways
between the huts, which were built on the piles supported by the stones.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>The relics collected were similar to those from Varese, of
which the following are the principal objects:&mdash;</p>

<p>A bronze hatchet (<i>coltello-ascia</i>) 5 inches long, and 1 to 2&frac14;
inches broad.</p>

<p>Pottery, including fragments with handles of various forms.</p>

<p>Dishes containing a black crust ("simile al residuo che la polenta
lascia in fondo al painolo dopo la cottura") were frequent. Some of
this stuff was submitted to Professor Sordelli for analysis, and he
thinks, from detecting in it the halves of acorns, that it was a kind
of porridge made from this fruit. One thin spindle-whorl 2 inches
in diameter had a few punctured dots on its surface, intended as an
ornamentation. One flint arrow-point, and a stone hatchet converted
into a polisher, like those already described from Varese. There were
also shells of hazel-nuts, and the kernels of the cornel cherry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pozzolo.</span>&mdash;This station was similar
to the former as regards the stony mounds, but only about half its
size. The principal relics from it were:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;A triangularly-shaped spear-head or dagger
3&frac14; inches long and an inch broad at its base, where there were
two rivet-holes; a hair-pin 3&frac12; inches long, with a ring head;
also a fish-hook.</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;A few chips, arrow-points, and a chisel of dark
flint; a hammer and polisher of the hatchet-shaped kind.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Fragments of a coarse and fine kind. Vases
containing the "sostanza terrosa" already noticed. One bone was found,
and in one spot there was a large quantity of cherry-stones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Occhio.</span>&mdash;The "Stazione dell'
Occhio" is near Monate, and consists of a mass of stones in water
from 10 to 14 feet deep; but, notwithstanding the difficulty of
searching in such a depth, the following industrial remains were
collected:&mdash;Chips of flint, charcoal, fragments of pottery,
shells of hazel-nuts, and a bronze hook&mdash;sufficient to show
that it belonged to the same period as the others.</p>

<h3>LAKE VARANO, TERNATE, OR COMABBIO.</h3>

<p>The previous failure of the early explorers and subsequently
of the experienced fisherman known as "Lo Spariss" in their
search for palafittes in Lake Varano did not prevent Castelfranco
from trying his luck in this lake also. In July, 1878, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
assistance of two fishermen experienced in lake-dwelling researches,
he made a tour of the lake (some 5 miles in circumference), and
discovered traces of no less than eight stations in different localities,
chiefly on the east shore. But the objects, though sufficiently
distinctive to show their origin, are too few and unimportant to
require any detailed notice.</p>

<p>Professor Castelfranco comes to the conclusion that in both the
lakes of Monate and Varano the palafittes are coeval with those in
Lake Varese. He is, however, struck with the entire absence of
bones from both of them&mdash;a fact which appears to him unaccountable.
(B. 321.)</p>

<h3>TORBIERA DI MOMBELLO</h3>

<p>Between the villages of Mombello and Cerro, on the east shore
of Lake Maggiore, and a few miles south of Laveno, there was
a small turbary in which Dr. Carlo Tinelli discovered the remains
of a palafitte. The peat was being excavated from 1844, but
it was 20 years later before the remains of the palafitte were
detected. The further progress of the peat-cutting was carefully
watched by Tinelli and a priest, Guiseppe Della Chiesa, in the
interests of archæology. Some of the piles were extracted, and
were said to show marks of having been fashioned by stone
implements.</p>

<p>The relics collected here are:&mdash;Flint objects in considerable
abundance, among which were two saws, a lance-head, and a
beautiful knife-flake (<b><a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a></b>, No. 1), now
in the Museum at Varese; fragments of coarsely-made dishes without handles
or ornamentation. Three canoes, roughly made and similar to those
from Mercurago, were found at a depth of 8 feet. One of the
canoes, 7 feet long, was presented to the Museum at Varese.
Along with these objects were bones of the stag, goat, and
roe. (B. 171.)</p>

<h3>TORBIERA DI VALCUVIA.</h3>

<p>In 1870 Professor Leopoldi Maggi described the remains of a
palafitte found in "un bacino torboso" between Santa Maria di
Cuveglio and Cavona. (B. 187.) This basin lies among glacial
<i>débris</i>, and was formerly a small lake, but in modern times
it became entirely filled up with peat. On the surface there was a
layer of vegetable soil 10 inches thick, then spongy peat to the
depth of 3 feet, and then a layer of more solid peat about 1 foot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
8 inches thick. Underneath these layers was a blackish muddy
deposit, extending to an unknown depth, into which the piles
were inserted. These piles were from 5 to 10 feet long, and
8 to 10 inches in diameter. They were closely set, and along
with them were several beams lying horizontally. The relics
consisted of pottery, knives of bronze and iron, charcoal,
etc., all of which were dispersed.</p>

<h3>TORBIERA DI BRENNO.</h3>

<p>Another locality that has yielded interesting remains, of "stazioni
palustri," is the "torbiera di Brenno-Useria," situated along the road
from Varese to Porto Ceresio, on Lake Lugano. Here, some years ago, a
canoe was dug out by the peat-cutters, and associated with it were a
large number of weapons of bronze and iron, bracelets, fibulæ
(<b><a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a></b>, No. 14), bones of domestic animals
and of man, but no objects of flint. (B. 327, p. 92.)</p>

<h3>LAKE OF LECCO.</h3>

<p>As early as 1860 Desor thought he had discovered indications
of a palafitte in Lake Maggiore,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
but this was subsequently disproved, and up to the present time no
remains of these ancient dwellings have been found in this lake. The
explanation of their absence in the larger lakes of Italy is to be
found in the physical conditions of these glacial and rock-cut basins,
which, owing to the depth of water and their rapidly-shelving shores,
afford no holding for piles.</p>

<p>Stoppani, in his first exploratory tour, turned his attention to
Lago di Lecco as, in his opinion, a suitable locality, and having
found a group of piles half-way between the Bridge of Lecco and
Malgrate stretching towards the western shore, he concluded this
was "una bella palafitta a cui nulla mancherebbe per ritrarre
perfettamente quelle della età del bronzo." The only resemblance of
this supposed palafitte to those of the Bronze Age was the fact
that the tops of the piles projected 1 or 2 feet above the lake mud,
as no relics of any kind were found. Further researches have not
confirmed the genuineness of this palafitte, and Regazzoni throws
out the hint that the piles observed by Stoppani might be the
work of modern fishermen, who are in the habit of inserting stakes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
for fixing their nets and which, among themselves, go under the
name of <i>serrade</i> or <i>gueglie</i>. (B. 67 and 327, p. 70.)</p>

<h3>LAKE OF ANNONE.</h3>

<p>In the narrow strait which connects the small lake-basins of
Sale and Annone, Stoppani found some piles projecting from a
heap of stones in a depth of 6 or 7 feet of water, which he took
to be indications of a palafitte. In 1877 Castelfranco (B. 307)
re-examined the locality, and came to the conclusion that the
submerged piles and stones observed by Stoppani were merely
the remains of a bridge which, at some former period, connected
the peninsula Isella with the southern shore; and so the matter
still rests.</p>

<h3>LAKE OF PUSIANO.</h3>

<p>More satisfactory discoveries were, however, made by Stoppani
in his preliminary tour in the Lake Pusiano, where, at the north
end of the Isola dei Cipressi, he recognised the existence of a
pile-dwelling. The genuineness of this station has been confirmed
both by Castelfranco and Regazzoni, who had subsequently made
some investigations in the locality. The industrial remains were
confined to a few objects of flint-saws, scrapers, flakes, and
arrow-points, a portion of a terra-cotta whorl, and some bones and
teeth of animals. In 1877 Regazzoni found piles at the other end of
the Isola dei Cipressi buried in a heap of stones. (B. 327, p. 72.)</p>

<h3>TORBIERA DI BOSISIO.</h3>

<p>To the east of Lake Pusiano lies the torbiera di Bosisio, which
came early under the notice of archæologists by the discovery in
it, at a depth of 10 feet, of a beautiful bronze axe-head (<b><a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a></b>,
No. 10). Since then a great many relics have been from time
to time found in this peat, but they have been widely dispersed,
and as the deposit is now nearly exhausted no more finds can
be looked for. Sig. G. B. Villa,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
in his descriptive notices of this peat moor, speaks of arrow-points,
burnt wood, bits of straw, trunks of trees, etc. Among other things
which have been sent to different museums are a bronze spoon (No. 11),
(probably of much later date than the other objects), some beautiful
arrow-points (Nos. 1 to 7), and a lance-head of flint. An iron hook of
modern shape was found at a depth of 3 feet. (B. 327, p. 97.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<h3>TORBIERA DI CAPRIANO.</h3>

<p>In 1869 Dr. Marinoni described a turbary at Capriano, near Renate
(B. 169), in which some remarkable objects of bronze were found at a
depth of about 7 feet. Similar objects are prevalent among the relics
from the Swiss lake-dwellings, and, judging from what we know of the
early Iron Age in Italy, they appear to belong to this period. The
find comprised a hair-pin (<b><a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a></b>, No. 13), a
fibula (No. 18), three bracelets (Nos. 15 and 16), a pendant (No. 17), and
a spiral ring (No. 19), all of which are here reproduced from Marinoni's work.

<h3>TORBIERA DI MAGGIOLINO.</h3>

<p>Sig. G. B. Villa, in his "Notizie sulle Torbe della Brianza"
(B. 90), describes another locality not far from Bosisio, in the
territory of Rogeno, called Maggiolino, in which piles, bones,
fragments of pottery, flint knives, and arrow-points, etc., were
found&mdash;evidently the usual <i>débris</i> of a palafitte. (See also B. 327, p. 97.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<h3>TORBIERA DI MERCURAGO.</h3>

<p>Since Gastaldi published his first report on the discovery of
palafittes in the bog of Mercurago by Professor Moro, many
additional objects from this locality have come to light, some
of which have been noticed and figured by Gastaldi in his
numerous articles on the antiquities of Lombardy. The peat is
now exhausted, but from these notices, together with an inspection
of the relics still preserved in the Turin Museum, we can have a
tolerably correct notion of this the first discovered lake-dwelling
in Italy. (B. 43, 52, 91, 168, and 294.)</p>

  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 53</b>.&mdash;Cover of Earthenware
Vessel (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>).</p>
</div>

<p>The peat basin of Mercurago is of an oblong shape, and the
antiquities and piles were in a circumscribed place at its northern
end, about 130 feet from the bank. Here in a space of 30 feet
square, cleared for antiquarian purposes, were counted 22 piles
bound together with cross timbers (<b><a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a></b>). The
superficial deposit of peat was about 6 feet in thickness, and the tops of the
piles reached half-way upwards, while their lower ends penetrated
from 3 to 4 feet into the lake mud below. Between this mud and the
superincumbent peat there was a bed of fern, and lying immediately
over it were three earthen dishes in good preservation, one of which
appears to be a lid or cover for another dish (<b><a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a></b>),
together with a large quantity of the broken fragments of others, a
bronze pin (<b><a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a></b>, No. 6), a scraper 4&frac34; inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
long (No. 7), several arrow-heads (<b><a href="#Fig_54">Fig. 54</a></b>), and quite
a litter of flint flakes, some shells of hazel-nuts, and stones of the cornel
cherry, etc.</p>

<p>The pottery was made of a blackish paste mixed with coarse
grains of sand or quartz, and a few dishes were ornamented with
patterns of zig-zag scratches separated by parallel lines (<b><a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a></b>,
No. 13). Some had handles, and others small ears or perforated
knobs, two of which had portions of string still attached to
them (<b><a href="#Fig_55">Figs. 55</a></b> and <b><a href="#Fig_56">56</a></b>).</p>

bronze, one still retaining a couple of rivets for fixing the handle
(<b><a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a></b>, No. 1); two bronze pins (Nos. 2 and 4); a

at the other with a hole as if for attaching a rope; a canoe 6 feet
long, 3&frac14; feet wide, and about a foot in depth (<b><a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a></b>); near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
canoe lay a bronze drill (<b><a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a></b>, No. 5); and a neat
spindle-whorl of baked clay 1&frac12; inch in diameter (No. 22). Among the more
recent finds are numerous flint arrow-heads and scrapers (No. 8);
a spindle-whorl of soapstone, <i>pietra ollare</i> (No. 16); a wooden
dish and perforated floats for nets; earthenware dishes of great
variety (No. 12); and 16 conical beads of vitreous paste, which,
when strung together, formed a handsome necklace (No. 9); and a
large cake of burnt clay perforated in the middle (No. 18).</p>

<p>But the most remarkable objects were two wooden wheels.
One (<b><a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a></b>) was made of three boards kept together with two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
crossbars dovetailed into the boards, and in the centre was a
round hole having on each side of it a semilunar space. This
wheel, which was not quite circular, had an average diameter of
2 feet. The other wheel (<b><a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a></b>) was differently
constructed. It had six spokes: two of them were made of the same piece of
wood as the nave, and their extremities formed part of the rim;
the other four, two on each side, connected the fellies with
the central piece. The fellies were neatly mortised together and
the workmanship was very good. These wheels were so far
decayed that they could not be preserved, but casts of them
were taken, which may now be seen in the Museum at Turin.</p>

<h3>TORBIERA DI BORGO-TICINO, ETC.</h3>

<p>Analogous remains to those in Mercurago have been found in several
other localities, especially in the districts called Pennino near
Borgo-Ticino, and the moor of Gagnano; but the objects were dispersed
or thrown away. A stone celt from this place is figured by Gastaldi
(<b><a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a></b>, No. 19).</p>

<p>In the neighbouring moor of Conturabia a group of piles was
observed in the centre of the bog which appears to have belonged to a
palafitte of a later date, as some of the piles were said to have been
tipped with iron. Gastaldi procured one of these piles, and although
this particular one had no iron on it he was convinced that it had
been sharpened by instruments similar to those in use at the present day. (B. 52.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<h3>TORBIERA DI SAN MARTINO (SAN GIOVANNI DEL BOSCO).</h3>

<p>This morainic basin is situated in the vicinity of Ivrea,
immediately to the south of the village of Giovanni, and it also has
yielded, from time to time, antiquities which leave no doubt that it
was a home of the lake-dwellers. The bog is of an oval shape, about
1&frac14; mile in length, and half this in breadth, and is beautifully
situated amidst groves of chestnut and walnut trees interspersed
through rich meadows and fields. On its margin are found the trunks of
trees, from 1 to 2 feet in diameter, still attached to their roots and
lying just as they had fallen with their points directed to the centre
of the bog. These trees are generally pine, oak, hazel, alder, etc.</p>

<p>Below the ordinary peat there is a layer of blackish mud which,
on being dried, is combustible, and underneath it lie the stratified
layers of ancient lake silt, consisting of a whitish clayey substance.
In the blackish intermediate layer there was found, in September,
1864, a canoe 8 feet 4 inches long, 1 foot 9&frac12; inches broad,
and 8 inches deep. (A model of this canoe is now in the Museum at
Turin.) A few years later (1868) another canoe was found in this
turbary, of slightly larger dimensions, having two paddles in it
(<b><a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a></b>, No. 17). The following objects are, among
others, described and figured by Gastaldi as coming from the same place,
viz.:&mdash;Specimens of pottery (Nos. 14 and 23), one of which (No.
23) is a lid of a vessel precisely similar to the one from Mercurago
(<b><a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a></b>); flint and stone implements
(<b><a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a></b>, No. 20);
wooden net-floats (No. 21); two bronze pins (Nos. 10 and 11);
and a remarkable bronze pendant (No. 15), supposed, however, to be of
Etruscan or Roman origin, and of later date than the other remains.
(B. 168 and 294.)</p>

<p>Other turbaries in the western districts of the Po that have
yielded prehistoric remains, but with which there were no piles
or other indications of lake-dwellings, are:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Torb. di Torre Bairo.</span>&mdash;Fragments
of vessels made on the wheel. In another small bog a quern-stone was
found which is supposed to be of Roman times.</p>

<h3>LAGOZZA.</h3>

<p>Lagozza is the name given to a small natural "bacino torbosa"
situated in an undulating plateau of morainic <i>débris</i>, about 4 miles
from Gallarate in the province of Milan. It is roughly oval in shape
and covers a superficial area of 10 or 12 acres. Till recently this
basin was a peaty bog, passable in summer, with certain precautions,
to "Cacciatori;" but in former times, as its name implies, it was a
stagnant lake. In 1875 the proprietor, Count Cornaggio, an ardent and
skilful agriculturist, determined to remove the peat altogether, and,
for this purpose, commenced operations by cutting a central canal to
carry off the water. While the workmen were thus engaged they began to
find near the middle of the bog bits of pottery, charcoal, and rotten
piles, which, on skilled attention being directed to them, turned
out to be undoubted indications of a prehistoric lake-dwelling. The
process of clearing out the peat was therefore watched with great
interest by local antiquaries, as the operation would involve a more
thorough investigation of the antiquities imbedded in the peat than
any researches that were likely to be undertaken solely from the
scientific point of view. It was not till the spring of 1880 that
the main portion of the palafitte was reached by the peat-cutters,
and then various antiquarian objects were met with. The turf is now
entirely removed, and the relics collected are deposited partly in
the Museo Civico in Milan, and partly in the Museo Archeologico at Como.</p>

<p>The pile-dwelling occupied a rectangular space, near the centre
of the <i>bacino</i>, about 80 yards long from north to south and 30
to 40 yards broad. The turf here varied in thickness from 1 to 2
yards, according to the state of moisture; below which there was a
muddy stratum containing the roots of water plants (<i>fango con
radice</i>), among which the tops of the piles appeared. This layer
was 16 inches thick, and immediately below it was the <i>strato
archeologico</i>, which varied in thickness from 2 to 8 inches, and
contained the usual <i>débris</i> of human occupancy embedded in a
matrix of black peat mud and earth. Below this again was a
stratum of black earth, mixed with the whitish clay or marl of the
ancient lake bottom, in which the points of the piles were firmly
fixed. The piles were pointed at the base and irregularly fixed,
4 or 5 to the square yard, and varied in length from 3&frac12; to 5
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
feet, with a diameter of 4 to 8 inches. Many prepared beams either of
round or split stems, some over 20 feet in length, lay buried in the
peat, as if they had fallen from a platform. Regazzoni draws attention
to some short beams having a square-cut hole at each end. One of these
beams measured 24&frac12; inches long, 4&frac34; broad, and 3&frac12;
thick, and the holes were 2&frac34; by 1&frac12; inches. The top of a
tree whose branches were neatly chopped off at the distance of 6 or 7
inches from the stem was supposed to have been used as a ladder.</p>

<p>Castelfranco thinks the points of the piles were fashioned by some
sharp-cutting instrument of metal, as some of the cuts were 11 inches
long, and such as no stone weapon could have produced ("non credo che
una scure di pietra sia mai stata capace di tanto"). This observation
is very significant in face of the fact that there is no object of
metal among the relics from Lagozza, with the exception of a fibula
(<b><a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a></b>, No. 18), found in the lower part of
the turf and, therefore, outside the well-defined relic-bed. This fibula belongs
to the early Iron Age, and it is doubtful whether it belonged to the
inhabitants of the palafitte. The same author also states that where
charcoal and partially burnt wood were in greater abundance there
also the relics were more numerous, and hence he concludes that the
settlement came to an end by a conflagration ("il risultato di un
incendio generale o di parecchi parziali").</p>

<p>Among the industrial remains collected from Lagozza pottery takes
the chief place. The quality is of two kinds, coarse and fine, the
latter having a smooth black appearance and without any admixture of
coarse sand. The vessels, of which a considerable number are whole or
nearly so, consist of cups, bowls, plates, vases, spoons, etc. They
are generally without handles, having, instead, perforated knobs,
as may be seen from the accompanying illustrations (<a href="#Fig_62"><b>Fig. 62</b></a>,
Nos. 2, 6, 7, 9, and 15). The plates are sometimes ornamented with
panels containing impressions of circles, dots, and lines (Nos. 3,
10, and 13). Some of the larger dishes have conical protuberances or
finger-marks round the margin (Nos. 1 and 4).</p>

<p>The spindle-whorls, about 40 of which are in the Museum at
Como, are somewhat peculiar, being flat circular cakes of burnt
clay with a hole in the centre, and often ornamented with lines or
rows of elliptical impressions (<a href="#Fig_61"><b>Fig. 61</b></a>, Nos. 12 to 17).</p>

<p>There are some clay weights of the usual conical shape, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
others kidney-shaped with a perforation at each end (<a href="#Fig_62"><b>Fig. 62</b></a>,
No. 14). In some of these weights bits of straw and grains of
barley and wheat have been detected.</p>

<p>There is not a single article made of bone or horn, nor any
trace of fishing or hunting gear, with the exception of one or two
arrow-heads (<b><a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a></b>, Nos. 5 and 6).</p>

</div>

<p>Stone celts are scarce, only about 30 in all, and none perforated
(No. 10). One small implement is in the form of a double-edged axe,
and adapted for cutting at both ends (No. 8).</p>

<p>Flint flakes or knives (Nos. 1 to 4) are numerous, but cores and
chips are less frequent. Arrow-points are extremely few&mdash;only
three have I seen in the Museum at Como, but their authenticity seems
to be questioned by Castelfranco, who thinks they were not actually
from the relic-bed in the palafitte. Among the usual stone objects,
such as hammers, rubbers, etc., are to be noticed a number of white
quartz pebbles and eight or nine small polished stones with scratched
markings on them (<b><a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a></b>, Nos. 11 and 12).

A wooden comb (<b><a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a></b>, No. 11), with teeth at one
side, is, I believe, the only specimen from any of the lake-dwellings in Italy.</p>

<p>Ornaments or charms are represented by one small pendant of green
steatite perforated for suspension (No. 7).</p>

<p>As evidence that the inhabitants were in the habit of spinning and
weaving, there are, besides the spindle-whorls and clay weights, bits
of thread and cord, and one small fragment of coarsely-made linen
tissue (No. 9). According to Professor Sordelli, this was made from
wild flax (<i>Linum angustifolium</i>), of which he found the seeds and
fibres in abundance, but no trace of the cultivated species. On the
other hand, there were two kinds of wheat and the six-eared barley.
Among the food-remains were the wild apple, acorns, hazel-nuts, stones
of the cornel cherry, poppy-seeds, etc.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable feature of Lagozza is, that no animal bones
of any description were found&mdash;not a tooth, or horn, or bone of
any kind. Neither were there any warlike weapons, with the exception
of the few questionable arrow-points. Castelfranco therefore suggests
that the inhabitants of Lagozza might have been vegetarians. (B. 354,
359b, 372d´, 387, 409, 452, 456, and 459c.)</p>

<h3>LAKE GARDA.</h3>

<p>In 1851, while the harbour of Peschiera was being deepened,
numerous bronze implements, associated with piles deeply buried
in the bed of the lake, were found at a particular spot near
the north mole of the fortress; but no special attention was paid
to them. The bronze objects were laid aside by the workmen,
and it is said that a quantity of them, weighing some 15 or 20
pounds, was sold as old metal. Of this find a very few were
sent to the K. K. Antiken Cabinet in Vienna. In 1860 further
deepening of the harbour became necessary, and again similar
objects were found in the dredged-up stuff. These operations
were conducted under the supervision of M. Lorenz and
Col. von Silber, who, in the interests of archæology, collected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
and preserved the bronze objects. Subsequently, on its being
suggested that this was a palafitte like those recently discovered
in the Swiss lakes, Col. von Silber forwarded an assortment of
the relics to Dr. Keller at Zürich, with the following explanatory
notice of the circumstances in which they were found:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In deepening the entrance of the harbour at Peschiera for
the newly-built gunboat, which was done by means of a mud-machine
(called a 'paternoster') to a depth of 7 or 8 feet
below the usual level of the water, the workmen found amongst
the mud and sand brought up by the machine a great number
of bronze implements. These were carefully preserved, for the
sake of archæology, by Mr. Lorenz, the marine engineer, now
residing at Pola, and myself. I was so uninitiated in this
science, that when I found that the greater part of the objects
had been taken up from a space of a very few square fathoms,
I had the notion that a ship, laden with bronze, had been
wrecked here, and it was not till a conversation which I had
with Dr. Freudenberg, of Bonn, that I was led to believe that
a lake-dwelling probably existed on this spot. This idea was
corroborated by the fact that just in this place the working of
the mud-machine was very much impeded by a number of
burnt piles which were quite covered with the mud. Unfortunately,
I fancied at first that these piles came from the fishermen's
huts, which abound in this neighbourhood at the present
day, so that I paid no attention to their position or arrangement.
The piles which were drawn up were, on an average, 4 or 5 feet
long, quite hidden under the sand, and burnt to such a degree
that it is quite impossible for me to say with certainty what
kinds of wood they were made of. I imagine, however, that
the wood was chiefly that of the stone oak (<i>Quercus ilex</i>).
The piles were 4 or 5 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>"Besides the bronze implements one of stone was found, which
I believe to be a sling-stone. Lately, when reading the reports
of the Swiss lake-dwellings, I remember the occurrence of a great
number of pieces of burnt clay found in the mud. These pieces
were of a blackish colour, remarkably thick, and without any
definite form. I do not doubt that they have been fragments of
the clay covering the huts of the lake-dwellings."
(B. 119, 2nd ed., p. 364.)</p>

<p>These discoveries induced the eminent archæologist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
 Dr. E. Freiherr von Sacken, to visit Peschiera for the purpose of
investigating into the reported Pfahlbau. In addition to his own
special researches he had correct details of the results already
obtained from Captain von Kostersitz, who was present, and
carefully watched the excavations during the years 1860-1-2,
and from these he drew up an admirable report, published in
1864 (B. 75), which clearly proved that there was here a true
pile-dwelling of the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>In this report the following sectional description of the
sedimentary strata is given:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) In a depth of about 5 feet of water there was first a sandy
layer from 2&frac12; to 3 feet thick in which no relics were found.</p>

<p>(2) Beneath this layer of sand was the relic-bed, from 2 to
3&frac12; feet thick, composed of a mossy deposit containing the
remains of plants, organic <i>débris</i>, the industrial objects already
referred to, and the tops of numerous piles.</p>

<p>(3) Underlying the relic-bed was a thick bed of stiff loam and
sand, into which the piles deeply penetrated. These piles were
generally of pine and oak, the former predominating in the proportion
of two to one.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the lake-dwelling were not accurately
ascertained, but the area covered by the dredging operations exceeded
10,000 square yards, and in most of this space piles were found.
No stone implements were found, with the exception of the polished
discoidal stone sent to Dr. Keller; but the number of bronze objects
amounted to 250, most of which were sent to Vienna.</p>

<p>Professor Franz Unger made a careful study of the organic
remains, and amongst the various fruits, plants, and wood identified
by him the most interesting are rye (<i>Secale cereale</i>) and
the vine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>). The former has not yet been found
in any of the terremare or lake-dwellings of North Italy.</p>

<p>The osseous remains represented the ordinary domestic animals&mdash;dog,
sheep, goat, ox, horse, and pig&mdash;as well as the stag, roe, wild
boar, etc.</p>

<p>Besides the bronze objects there were fragments of pottery and
one or two Roman coins&mdash;one of Trajan and one of Domitian.</p>

<p>Meantime archæologists were on the look out for palafittes in
other parts of the lake. It appears that as early as 1861 Cav.
Martinati detected piles at a place called Rocca di Garda, near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Bardolino, on the eastern shore of the lake, which he considered
to be the remains of a pile-dwelling. Dr. Alberti also discovered
similar evidence in two localities farther south, Il Bor and Porto di
Pacengo, which he described in a letter to Martinati in 1864. (B. 77
and 355.) This stimulated the Accad. d'Agricoltura, Arti, e Commercio
di Verona to appoint a Commission to investigate the matter; but their
labours were soon afterwards discontinued owing to the political
disturbances of 1866, and it was not till ten years later that these
proposed archæological researches were resumed and the Commission
re-constituted. Although on this occasion no bronze objects were
found, it cannot be said that the explorations were altogether devoid
of interest, as the existence of the reported palafittes was not only
confirmed, but a considerable quantity of the osseous remains of the
ordinary domestic animals, fragments of pottery (including handles
known as <i>anse lunate</i>), and a wooden spoon were collected. But the
Commission soon abandoned the work as profitless. Then it was that
Mr. Alberto Cavazzocca, of Verona, commenced to search Il Bor on his
own account, and succeeded in a couple of seasons in securing from
it a small collection of antiquities, including objects of stone and bronze.</p>

<p>On the western and more sheltered shores of Lake Garda Professor
Stoppani, of Milan, found traces of several stations, particularly in
the Gulf San Felice di Scovolo, three of which were situated close to
its northern shore, and two close to the Isola Lecchi on the landward
side of the island. As few relics were found&mdash;only a few flint
objects&mdash;and as the piles in all these stations were near the
shore and in comparatively shallow water, Stoppani concluded they
belonged to the Stone Age. These explorations were a sequence to the
first researches in Lake Varese, so auspiciously initiated by Desor
and Mortillet, and which Stoppani followed up by making an exploratory
tour of the lakes of North Italy. The observations of Stoppani,
however, have not been confirmed by any subsequent researches,
though this particular locality is pre-eminently the most fitted for
lake-dwellings in the whole of this extensive sheet of water. (B. 87.)</p>

<p>In 1879, under the skilful management of Cav. Stefano de
Stefani (R. Ispettore degli Scavi, Verona), dredging operations were
resumed at the old place in the harbour of Peschiera, which considerably
added to the number of relics from this station.</p>

<p>In the spring of the following year De Stefani transferred his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
operations to an entirely new locality in the river Mincio, below the
railway bridge, where the stream divides into a number of separate
channels. Among the islands thus formed he had reason to suspect
the existence of pile-dwellings, and in this expectation he was not
disappointed, as he succeeded in finding not only the submerged
piles and transverse beams, but also a large number of flint, and
some bronze objects, and even a few Roman remains.</p>

<p>As both these investigations were undertaken by orders from
the Minister of Public Instruction and at the expense of Government
the relics were sent to enrich the prehistoric department
of the Kircherian Museum at Rome.</p>

<p>The people of Verona were greatly chagrined to find that these
successive discoveries, which had now attained much celebrity in
archæological circles, were constantly slipping out of their hands,
and that in their own local museum there was scarcely a single article
illustrative of the culture and social condition of these early
lake-dwellers. To rectify this state of matters and make some amends
for their past neglect the Academical Commission was induced to order
a fresh investigation under De Stefani, whose recent success was
characterised as "risultati splendidissimi." Again the excavations of
De Stefani were crowned with great success. In 1881 his attentions
were directed to Peschiera, which yielded him a considerable number
of articles, being the fourth important supply since its discovery
in 1851. In 1883 the station in the Mincio was subjected to further
explorations, and De Stefani's labours were rewarded by a rich
harvest of relics, mostly of the Stone Age, which included many flint
implements, as knives, hatchets, saws, arrow-points, etc.</p>

<p>The relics collected on both these occasions are now deposited
in the Museo Civico at Verona, and at last this town shares with
Rome, Vienna, and Zürich, the honour of possessing a collection of
these remarkable remains. (B. 342, 358, 370, 424, and "Notizie
degli Scavi, 1880 and 1884.")</p>

<p>From these general remarks it will be seen that there are only
three lake-dwellings in Lake Garda that have yielded remains
sufficiently comprehensive in quantity and variety to enable us
to form some idea of the period to which they belonged, viz. the
station close to the fortress of Peschiera, that in the Mincio, and
that known as Il Bor on the south-east shore of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peschiera.</span>&mdash;Since the report of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Baron v. Sacken the various researches conducted here have not thrown
additional light on the general condition and distribution of the
piles. De Stefani bears testimony to the accuracy of the facts as to
the archæological stratum in which the relics were found, and observes
that the overlying bed of sand and gravel sometimes attained a depth
of over 4 feet. (B. 424, p. 9.) In it were found decomposed organic
matter, bits of charcoal, fragments of pottery, and bronze objects.
In the previous discoveries only one stone implement was recorded,
so that the station was considered to be exclusively of the Bronze
Age. Nor was its character in this respect much altered by the recent
researches, as only a few implements of stone were found, viz. two
knives or scrapers, one arrow-point and a few chips of flint, a round
sling-stone of granite, and another of an oval form with marks of
having been used. Nothing of importance was added as regards its
<i>flora</i> and <i>fauna</i>. De Stefani describes a curious object like
a biscuit, picked out of the dredged stuff, which he considered might
have been a cake of bread. It was made of viscous matter and measured
4 inches in diameter and &frac34; of an inch thick, and contained
bruised cereals; but, as he was examining it, it slipped through his
fingers and again fell into the water. (B. 424, p. 10.)</p>

<p>This settlement appears to have flourished exclusively in the
Bronze Age, as may be seen from a glance at the accompanying
illustrations (<b><a href="#Fig_63">Figs. 63</a></b>,
<b><a href="#Fig_64">64</a></b>, and <b><a href="#Fig_65">65</a></b>).</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;The fragments of earthenware indicate a great
variety of vessels made of two kinds of paste&mdash;a coarse and
a fine quality. Of the latter, Nos. 26 to 30, <b><a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a></b>,
are sufficient to show that the ceramic art of the lake-dwellers
was identical at one period of their existence with that of
the terramaricoli in which the <i>anse lunate</i> (No. 26) are so
characteristic.</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;Weapons, implements, and ornaments of this material
are extremely numerous, numbering upwards of 300 objects. Among the
weapons we find socketed lance-heads (<b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>, No. 10),
daggers (No. 1 to 7), single-edged knives (No. 11), and a remarkable series of
double-edged dagger-knives with riveted tangs or sword-like handles
(<b><a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a></b>, Nos. 10, and 12 to 14).</p>

<p>The implements include three kinds of hatchets (<b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>,
No. 30; <b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>, No. 32, and <b><a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a></b>, No. 11),
chisels and gouges (<b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>, No. 36), sickles (No. 33), various forms
of razors with handle and double cutting edges (Nos. 1 to 5), needles
(No. 7), and fish-prongs and hooks (<b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>, Nos. 18 to 21, 30 and 31).

The ornamental objects are hair-pins, combs, pendants, bracelets,
fibulæ, and a torque. Hair-pins are in great numbers and of extreme
elegance both in form and ornamentation (profusely illustrated in
<b><a href="#Fig_63">Figs. 63</a></b>, <b><a href="#Fig_64">64</a></b>,
and <b><a href="#Fig_65">65</a></b>); among them are some with
amber heads (<b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>, Nos. 9 and 10); some have
flat, others disc-shaped, heads (Nos. 17, 18, and 25); especially interesting
are those with heads made of various combinations of spirals (Nos.
21 to 27), as being identical with the hair-pins of the terremare.
Combs are of bone (No. 29) as well as of bronze (No. 28). Pendants
of curious and varied forms are also abundant (<b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>,
Nos. 27 to 29), among which one (<b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>, No. 34) is of
lead. The small ornamental cross represented by No. 26, <b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>,
is of tin. The fibulæ are also of diversified forms, as may be seen from the
illustrations (<b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>, Nos. 8, and 22 to 25). The
bracelets are of two kinds, made of thin bands (<b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>,
Nos. 31 and 32), one closed with a hook and the other open. Only one torque (No.
19) has been found at Peschiera, and in form it is similar to the few
recorded from the Swiss lake-dwellings (<b><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></b>, No. 3).</p>

<p>Finally there are a few spirals, bits of wire, and one special
object of unknown use (<b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>, No. 17).</p>

<p>The relationship which these objects have to analogous remains
in foreign countries is most exhaustively and ably dealt with by
Professor Pigorini. (B. 310.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mincio.</span>&mdash;As the surplus water of
Lake Garda, under the name Mincio, passes beyond the railway-bridge,
it divides into two larger channels and some smaller ones, forming
a series of acutely-pointed islands. The bed is here irregular, and
at various points the tops of piles were seen in groups projecting
from the bed of the river. The first explorations were in the
larger channel to the left. Here De Stefani found several objects
of antiquity, among which the following are the principal (B.
358):&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;The corroded blade of a knife-dagger
(double-edged), portion of a dagger-blade with a mid-rib, portion of
another with deep longitudinal grooves, portion of a small disc and
portion of a spiral.</p>

<p><i>Flint.</i>&mdash;Two rectangularly-shaped hatchets, a saw (curved),
a javelin, an arrow-point, a lance-head, small knives, and a large
quantity of chips, cores, and crude flints.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Two spindle-whorls, a quantity of handles and
fragments of dishes.

<p><i>Staghorn.</i>&mdash;A portion converted into the form of a hatchet, a
hair-pin, and several other worked bits.</p>

<p><i>Bones, etc.</i>&mdash;A large quantity of teeth and bones of the
ordinary domestic animals.</p>

<p>At another spot, 200 yards lower down in the central canal, amidst
a group of piles he collected:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;A knife (<b><a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a></b>, No. 17),
two small dagger-blades with rivet-holes, the point of a sickle, two bits of the
cutting-ends of axes (paalstabs), two hair-pins 10 inches long and
three smaller ones, a disc-shaped head of a pin, portions of a fibula,
together with fragments of various other undetermined objects. One
interesting relic is supposed to be the knob of a handle (No. 25).</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;One portion of a polished stone of basalt (No. 19).</p>

<p><i>Flint.</i>&mdash;The implements of this material were here in great
abundance (Nos. 1 to 9). Eighteen hatchets, mostly of a rectangular
form (No. 9); 60 saws (Nos. 5 and 6); 49 arrow-points (Nos. 1 to 4),
of which one (No. 4) has four barbs and another is chisel-shaped (No.
8); 13 lance-heads (No. 7), etc.</p>

<p><i>Amber.</i>&mdash;Two beads, one reddish and the other yellow.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Various fragments, especially handles of
vessels of different forms&mdash;<i>cornuta</i>, <i>lunata</i>, <i>lagotis</i>,
<i>bitubercolata</i>, etc. Some of the dishes were of fine black ware,
among which I may note a spoon (No. 30), but generally the coarser
kinds predominated. Spindle-whorls were also numerous and varied in
form, not less than 31 being collected. There were also two large net
weights, one round and the other ring-shaped.</p>

<p><i>Staghorn.</i>&mdash;Several worked bits: one was a portion of an
ornamented comb and another part of a handle of some sort.</p>

<p><i>Money.</i>&mdash;Four coins, much corroded, supposed by De Stefani to
be of the second half of the third century.</p>

<p>In 1883 De Stefani resumed his researches in the same place.
(B. 424.) On this occasion the bronze objects were limited to
one or two insignificant fragments; but, on the other hand, the
flint implements increased&mdash;knives, saws, javelins, lance-heads
and arrow-heads being in abundance. Among the other things I
may mention two small stone discs perforated, probably used as
spindle-whorls; a small bit of green glass, together with portions
of worked and unworked horn, bone, etc.</p>

<p>The ornamental blade (<b><a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a></b>, No. 18), a neat spiral-headed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
pin (No. 22), and a stud (No. 23), all of bronze, are in the collection
of Dr. Rambotti, and said to be from the station in the Mincio.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Il Bor.</span>&mdash;Previous to the
investigations of Il Bor by Cavazzocca (B. 355), Dr. Alberti had
estimated the number of heads of piles visible on this station at
500, but this number the former considers rather high. The station
stretched parallel to the shore, from which its site is now distant
about a hundred yards; but it is supposed that the present level of
the water stands higher than it was in the days of the lake-dwellers.
One reason for this opinion is that a triple row of piles which runs
shorewards, and is considered to be the remains of a gangway, was
found to terminate suddenly about half-way. The <i>strato archeologico</i>
lies under a thin covering of sand and gravel, which Cavazzocca
explains to be the débris of the disintegrated morainic coast carried
outwards by the boisterous action of the waves.</p>

<p>The principal relics collected by Cavazzocca are as follows, most
of which are illustrated in his monograph:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;Four knife daggers similar to those from Peschiera;
three pin-heads, "<i>capocchie di aghi crinali</i>" (<b><a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a></b>,
No. 24), like those from the terremare; one axe-head with wings, like No.
30, <b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>; one conical button; two chisels
(<b><a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a></b>, No. 15); four hair-pins; two fragments
of spiral tubes (No. 20), and six undetermined objects.</p>

<p><i>Pottery</i> showed diverse forms, including <i>anse lunate</i>, and
fragments of vessels, spindle-whorls, etc.</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Three fragments of stone moulds, several whetstones,
and an arrow, knife, and several chips of flint.</p>

<p>An arrow-point of bronze (No. 16) and a couple of small daggers
from Il Bor are in the Museum of Rome.</p>

<h3>LAKE FIMON. (B. 83, 110, 132, and 295.)</h3>

<p>About four miles to the south of Vicenza, at the southernmost
point of an irregularly-shaped valley of rich meadow-land,
lies the small lake of Fimon. At the present time it is hardly
a couple of miles in circumference, but before the Debba Canal,
which carries its surplus water to the river Bacchiglione, was
cut, it is known to have been considerably larger, and in
prehistoric times it is supposed to have covered the larger part
of the valley. In a meadow called Pascalone, near its north
end, and close to where the Debba Canal begins, Mr. Lioy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
detected the tops of piles jutting out of the grass, which he at
once concluded to be the remains of a lake-dwelling&mdash;a supposition
which was completely verified by extensive excavations.
The surface of the meadow where these piles were visible was
less than 2 feet above the level of the lake, and on making
excavations over a selected portion the following facts were
ascertained:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Piles.</i>&mdash;The piles were from 8 to 12 inches in diameter,
singly and irregularly placed, but sometimes in groups; some were
hard and black (oak), and others soft, but they bore no traces of
any cutting implements. In some instances they were surrounded with
heaps of stones. They penetrated deeply, and one which was pulled up
measured 18 feet in length. No traces of a gangway stretching to the
shore could be discovered.</p>

<p><i>Relic-bed.</i>&mdash;Below a thin covering of vegetable-mould there
was a peaty bed about 16 inches thick, and underneath this, lake-marl
containing various kinds of fresh-water shells to the extent of 3 feet
4 inches. To this succeeded the <i>strato archeologico</i> with its various
contents&mdash;decomposed organic matter, broken bones, fragments of
pottery, flint implements and other worked stones, bits of straw,
reeds, charcoal, clay plaster, burnt faggots, etc. This bed was about
12 inches thick, and its matrix was of a yellowish-black colour,
which, when cut into, had a doughy consistency and emitted a strong
sulphurous smell.</p>

<p><i>Relics.</i>&mdash;The rough stone implements were made out of the
limestone of the neighbouring hills, very seldom of sandstone, but
more frequently of flint from the spurs of the Alps. These flints were
in considerable numbers in the form of chips, nuclei, and unfinished
implements, very few of which were well formed; a few rudely-formed
arrow-points, lance-heads, knives, and saws or scrapers; pebbles of
limestone, probably hammer-stones; stone discs, 2 to 4 inches in
diameter (only one was perforated); also numerous sling-stones made of
sandstone, basalt, and serpentine; one fragment of granite, flattened
and polished on all the four sides, but only one small polished stone
celt. Many of the bones were worked, and there were tynes of staghorn,
sharpened at the top and perforated at the base; also pointers,
spear-heads, spatulæ, and splinters of all kinds.</p>

<p>The fragments of pottery were so plentiful that a handful
of mud could not be taken up without finding some pieces in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
it. Amongst some thousands of fragments about 50 vessels in
a more or less perfect condition were picked out. They are all
of a dark colour, with handles attached, generally below the
rim, and flat bases. Some of them have everted lips, and many
are ornamented with knobs, depressions, or raised ridges (circular,
wavy, or confluent). Some of the handles approach the form
known as <i>anse lunate</i>, others terminate in a round button
(<i>ansa mono-appendiculata</i>). One small bowl had two handles.
The paste was of two qualities: one fine, and the other mixed
with coarse bits of gravel, quartz, and carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>Numerous specimens of spindle-whorls. They are flat circular
cakes of clay, like small wheels, perforated and unornamented.</p>

<p><i>Organic Remains.</i>&mdash;Fruit of the water-chestnut (<i>Trapa
natans</i>), kernels of cherries, hazel-nuts, acorns, bramble seeds, etc.</p>

<p>The bones of the stag and wild boar seem to predominate
among those of the sheep, ox, roe, badger, etc.; also a large
quantity of the broken carapaces of a small fresh-water turtle
(<i>Emys lutaria</i>).</p>

<p>Some five or six years later (1871) Mr. Lioy made further
excavations near the same place, and came upon a relic-bed
8 inches in thickness and only 16 inches below the surface,
which he considered to be the remains of a pile-dwelling of a
later age. In this relic-bed he found a bronze celt (<b><a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a></b>,
No. 1) and some flints of a grey-reddish or yellowish colour
(different from the blue variety in the earlier dwelling), but no
stone implements and no arrow-points. Pottery was not abundant,
but it was made of a finer quality and the ornamentation shows
a higher style of art. Mr. Lioy also observes that the bones of
the domestic animals, such as sheep and oxen, are now in excess
of those of wild animals.</p>

<p>As a final report of the <i>abitazioni lacustri</i> of Lake Fimon
(B. 295) Mr. Lioy has published a lengthy monograph with
numerous plates of illustrations. The work, however, deals more
with extraneous and general considerations than specific facts or
details bearing on the remains of the palafittes in this lake.
I consider the station at Polada, with its remarkable relics, far
more typical of the Stone Age lake-dwellings, and I have
accordingly selected it as a standard for such remains in the
eastern valley of the Po. Moreover, Mr. Lee (B. 119, 2nd ed.)
has already presented to English readers an abridgement of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Lioy's work, with no less than nine plates of illustrations;
whereas a report of the discoveries at Polada has not yet been
published at all. I have, therefore, restricted my illustrations from
Lake Fimon to the few objects on <b><a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a></b>, which include
a bronze flat celt, a large clay ring, and a few specimens of pottery.</p>

<h3>ARQUÀ-PETRARCA.</h3>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Padua remains of lake-dwellings presenting
in many respects similar characteristics to those in Lake Fimon,
have recently been discovered in the small lake of Arquà-Petrarca
situated in the Euganean hills. It was discovered in the autumn of
1885 by Professor Frederico Cordenons, who, with the aid of funds from
the Museums of Padua and Este, made excavations during this and the
following summer, the result of which he has just published. (B. 464.)
It appears that the lake, though now only covering some dozen acres,
was formerly of much greater extent and occupied the whole of the
present valley. In the slime of this ancient lake-basin, which is now
overlaid with a deposit of peat over 3 feet in thickness, the remains
of two stations were found, one on the eastern and the other on the
western margin of the present lake. These remains, which consist of
piles, portions of transverse beams, and a large assortment of the
industrial <i>débris</i> of the inhabitants, are entirely confined to the
ancient mud deposit, nothing being found in the peat above it. Mr.
Cordenons does not give as minute a description of the relic-bed and
its surroundings as could be desired; but as only a fourth of the area
occupied by the piles has been excavated (1,000 square yards), the
present report may be only a first instalment of the researches.</p>

<p>Among the objects collected, the following will give a general idea
of its chronological position with respect to analogous remains in the
Po valley:&mdash;Several perforated stone axes, half of a perforated
hammer-axe of green serpentine beautifully polished, a large
hammer-stone, a beautiful flint saw four inches long ("un bellissimo
coltello-sega"), portion of a finely-worked laurel-leaf-shaped
lance-head of flint, a number of arrow-heads, lance-heads, saws,
knives, etc., of flint.</p>

<p>Objects of staghorn were not numerous, and only some perforated
rings of this material are recorded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The pottery is abundant, and with the description of it much
of Cordenons's monograph is taken up. The paste in the generality
of the vessels is mixed with sand and bits of mica, recognised
to be the <i>débris</i> of the surrounding hills. Only one dish
(<b><a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a></b>, No. 11) showed ornamentation of incised lines, but, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the other hand, raised lines meeting in points, forming triangles,
etc., were most common. The handles were of various shapes and
showed a complete series of the progressive stages, from the single
button-shaped top to the almost perfect <i>ansa cornuta</i>.</p>

<p>No metal objects were found, and consequently Mr. Cordenons
concludes that the station belonged to the pure Stone Age, a
conclusion which, however, Pigorini disputes. (B. 466b.)</p>

<p>The pottery is very similar to that from the adjacent
lake-dwellings at Fimon, and by no means dissimilar to that from
Polada.</p>

<h3>POLADA.</h3>

<p>About half-way between Desenzano sul Lago and the village of
Lonato, and a little to the south of the direct railway between
Milan and Venice, there is, in the midst of a series of morainic
hillocks, a small bowl-shaped hollow, scarcely 300 yards in
diameter, which at one time formed a stagnant lake called Polada.
It appears that at some former period, of which there is now no
record, this pool had been partially drained by means of a small
tunnel which was pierced through the morainic lip on its north
side, and so carried off the water to a lower valley. The result
of this was to expose a considerable portion of the lake-bottom,
one part of which formed a tongue-like projection or promontory
attached to its eastern margin. This continued to be the condition
of Polada for many ages, and in course of time the remaining
portion of the lake became completely filled up with peat. Some
years ago the proprietors of this bog commenced to utilise its
contents as fuel, and, to facilitate this operation, the margin of
the crater-like cavity was pierced by a second tunnel at a lower
level than the former, so as to get rid of the water. It was then
found that the promontory of land, which since its original
exposure had been cultivated, had been only partially bared
by the first drainage, as on its inner side there was a thin covering
of peat, which a little farther on suddenly sank to a great depth. In
the course of removing this covering of peat from the tip of the
promontory, and just on the margin of the cultivated land, some
rotten piles and other indications of a prehistoric dwelling were
discovered. Dr. Giovanni Rambotti, President of the Liceo
Ginnasio at Desenzano, recognised this to be the remains of a
lake-dwelling erected on piles, and so greatly did he interest
himself in the objects recovered and daily turning up that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
arranged with the workmen to preserve all the relics for him. This
discovery was made in 1872, and, as the operation of clearing out
the peat progressed during the following two or three years, the
settlement turned out to be very rich in industrial remains. Now
that the turf is entirely removed and all the relics kept together
Dr. Rambotti finds himself the possessor of one of the most valuable
and instructive collections of lake-dwelling remains in Italy.</p>

<p>From an inspection of the original outlet Dr. Rambotti calculates
that before the first tunnel was executed this tongue of land
would be covered by eight to ten feet of water, and he thinks
that in this depth of water the lake-dwellers must have erected
their piles and platform. That portion of the site might have
been exposed and destroyed when the first drainage was made, is
probable; but at any rate sufficient remained to be able to form
some opinion as to its size. When I visited the locality with
Dr. Rambotti he gave me the following dimensions, which he
derived from a careful study of the locality and disposition of
the piles. Its form was that of an oblong parallelogram, 65 yards
long and about one-third of this distance in breadth. Its
longest diameter ran nearly east and west, and the dwelling thus
presented its short side to the nearest shore. Two rows of piles,
about two feet apart, stretched to the shore, a distance of about
100 yards, and Dr. Rambotti justly concluded this to be
the remains of a gangway. A shallow canoe, 25 feet long and
30 inches wide, having traces of fixtures for oars at three equidistant
spots on each side, was found near the site of the lake-dwelling.
Portions of a second canoe, apparently of smaller
dimensions, were disinterred at the land end of the gangway.</p>

<p>But the valuable feature of this lake-dwelling is the large
and unique assortment of industrial remains which it has furnished,
all of which are kept together at the private residence
of Dr. Rambotti, where they constitute a respectable museum.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;The larger vessels were made of coarse
greyish clay, mixed with rough sand or pebbles; but the smaller
and more ornamental were composed of a fine black homogeneous
paste. Besides a large quantity of fragments, there are in
Rambotti's collection about 150 vessels, more or less entire,
showing a considerable variety of size and form, according to the
uses for which the vessels were intended. Some were large
wide-mouthed jars, with two, or sometimes four, handles. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
largest of this class measured 15 inches across the mouth and 9 inches
in depth. One flat dish was 12 inches in diameter and only 4 deep,
while another was flower-pot-shaped and measured 10 inches across
at the top, 5 &frac12; at the base, and 12 in depth. Another dish
(<b><a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a></b>, No. 37) was perforated all over with small
round holes, arranged in upright and equidistant rows, of which there were
in all thirty, each row having eight holes. The measurements of this
curious percolator are 10&frac12; inches across the mouth, 8 at the
base, and 4&frac12; in depth. Some vessels, especially the larger
vases, were ornamented with a line of perforations or projecting knobs
round the rim; others again had a ridge marked here and there with a
knob round its bulging part (<b><a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a></b>, No. 6).
Few were without handles. In one or two instances there was a hollow protuberance,
instead of a handle, sufficiently prominent to be grasped, and the
hollow part communicated with the interior of the vessel. The handles
were attached generally at the rim, but often below it, and sometimes
half-way down the side of the vessel. The largest handle I noticed
measured 6 inches from its two points of attachment. Some of the
handles were surmounted by a button-shaped prominence (No. 10); others
terminated in a bifurcation like a couple of horns, which strongly
suggests a rudimentary form of the <i>ansa lunata</i>, so characteristic
of the terremare (Nos. 13 and 14). Of the finer kind of pottery there
are a great variety of dishes, which may be classed as cups, bowls,
plates, jugs, etc., some of which were ornamented with simple designs
made with dots and lines (Nos. 9, 10, and 11). One handle had the form
of a cross punctured on it, having one arm prolonged into a long stem
running downwards, just like a modern Christian cross.</p>

<p>About 140 spindle-whorls of terra-cotta, some of which are
variously ornamented (<b><a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a></b>, Nos. 28, 29, and 36). A
considerable number of perforated clay weights, of which five are
flat, with the hole in the centre (<b><a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a></b>, Nos. 19
and 20). The most novel objects were a few oblong cakes of terra-cotta
ornamented with repeating lines of small circular depressions
(<b><a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a></b>, Nos. 22 to 24).

<i>Stone Objects.</i>-A large sandstone polisher, together with a number
of smaller ones. About 40 hammer-stones of quartz, serpentine, etc.,
some having finger-depressions. A few perforated stones, used as
sinkers or hammers. Six round stones about the size of an egg, found
in the canoe. Of polished celts there were only six of the usual type
(<b><a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a></b>, Nos. 15 and 16). One of the most remarkable
features of the collection is the number of arrow-points, which exceed 300,
presenting in this respect a remarkable contrast to Lagozza. As will
be seen from the illustrations (<b><a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a></b>, Nos. 1 to 19)
these arrow and lance-heads are varied in form and exceedingly well made.
Eight are of a rhomboidal shape, and a similar number have only one
barb (No. 7). Three rectangular plates of polished stone, perforated
at the corners, were probably used to protect the wrist of the
archer (Nos. 34 and 35). Flint saws to the extent of nearly 100, of
which a few are unique. One has slanting teeth as shown in No. 20,
which represents both sides of the flint. A few were still in their
handles when found. One is very remarkable (<b><a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a></b>, No. 12)
as being formed of four separate flints fixed in a wooden casing by
means of a groove and asphalt. This casing or handle has a grasping
portion at each end&mdash;in short, it is a double-handed saw. The
illustration represents this implement lying flat, and the horn-like
ending projects upwards at an angle of about 40°, so that when
placed in working position with the flints downwards, the horn-like
projection would be directed to the left. Hence Dr. Rambotti thought
the lake-dwellers were left-handed men. There were two other wooden
casings, precisely similar, but minus the flints.</p>

<p><i>Horn und Bone.</i>&mdash;About 40 daggers and pointers of bone, of
which 12 are made from split leg-bones and beautifully polished like
those from Laibach and other places. A number of small pointed objects
of bone, chisels, pins, etc. (<b><a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a></b>, Nos. 25 to 27). Seven
perforated axe hammer-heads of staghorn (<b><a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a></b>, No. 17), also
similar to those from Laibach.</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;A bronze dagger (No. 1) with a neatly-worked bone
handle terminating in a button-shaped capsule. The blade was attached
to a semilunar capsule of thin bronze by rivets. Portions of worked
bone similar to the handle of this weapon were supposed to belong to
other analogous weapons. Three flat celts of the terramara type
(Nos. 2 and 3).</p>

<p><i>Ornaments.</i>&mdash;Eight bone rings, one of which is ornamented
with small circles (<b><a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a></b>, No. 33). Three perforated
buttons or spindle-whorls of marble (No. 30). Several other forms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
buttons in stone or marble (Nos. 21 and 32). Several perforated teeth
of dog, wolf, bear (No. 31), and wild boar; also one perforated shell.</p>

<p>Dr. Rambotti thinks that there was satisfactory evidence to
conclude that the settlement had been destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>No report of this remarkable lake-dwelling has yet been published
in Italy, but the principal objects were exhibited at a Congress of
Art and Archæology held at Brescia in the autumn of 1875. On this
occasion no less than fourteen pages of the published catalogue of the
exhibition are devoted to the enumeration of Dr. Rambotti's collection
from Polada.</p>

<h3>CASCINA, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></h3>

<p>The Torbiera di Cascina, situated between Castelnuovo and San
Georgio, in Salice, has from time to time yielded objects which,
there can be no doubt, belonged to ancient pile-dwellers. The station
was first recognised by Martinati (<i>Adige</i>, 1874, No. 23), who found
flint arrow-points, a laurel-leaf-shaped lance-head, some stone
implements, bits of staghorn, etc. In 1878 Pigorini gives a further
account (B. 328d') of some of the objects since discovered, including
18 flint pieces&mdash;arrow-points of various forms, including one
of the so-called rhomboidal type (<i>selce romboidale</i>), a magnificent
lance-head, a fine saw, and one small triangular chisel. In the Museo
Kircheriano at Rome there are also preserved a bronze axe of the flat
type (<b><a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a></b>, No. 9) and a curious knife of bronze (No. 12),
similar to those from the lake-dwelling at Peschiera, which were found
in this place.</p>

<p>Martinati (B. 279, p. 179) also describes another small torbiera in
the vicinity of Lazise, in which three rows of piles were encountered,
and associated with them were fragments of black pottery. It was also
reported that in past years entire vessels of the same kind were found
in the locality.</p>

<h3>TERREMARE.</h3>

<p>Shortly after the middle of last century certain artificial
deposits of an earthy substance found scattered in the shape of
large, flattish mounds, over the provinces of Parma, Reggio, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Modena, became known to agriculturists as possessing great fertilising
power&mdash;a property which they henceforth turned to advantage by
using their contents as manure. To such an extent has this practice
been carried that many of these deposits, notwithstanding their great
extent, covering, in most instances, many acres, have now entirely
disappeared. This substance looks like a mixture of clay, sand, ashes,
etc., arranged in differently-coloured strata&mdash;yellowish-brown,
green or black&mdash;and goes among the peasants under the name of
<i>marna</i> or <i>mèrne</i>; but in scientific circles it is generally called
terramara, more especially since the meeting of the International
Congress at Bologna. In the course of these annual excavations various
objects of antiquity were noticed by the workmen, such as Roman coins
and tiles; implements of bone, horn, bronze, etc.; the bones of
domestic and wild animals; and even human bones, were occasionally
turned up. But these popular observations failed to lead to any
scientific investigation, and when these mysterious mounds happened to
be noticed by the early writers of this century each had a theory of
his own to account for them. Thus the celebrated naturalist Venturi,
in his "Storia di Scandiano," published in 1822, assigns them partly
to the Boii, a Celtic race who here, according to him, cremated their
dead warriors and ceremoniously threw their weapons and animals
taken in war into the burning pile; and partly to the Romans, who
subsequently inhabited the country, and selected these heaps for their
dwellings and burial-places. Others supposed them to be the sacred or
traditional cemeteries of successive races, and hence their contents
are called "terrecime-teriale"; and it is a curious fact that many of
these truncated mounds are to this day crowned by a modern church or
convent, around which the Christians have been in the habit of burying
their dead. Nor did the opinion of Gastaldi, published in 1861 (B.
43), throw much light on the matter. Seeing that the terremare were
invariably situated near running streams, he considered them heaps of
the remains of different, ages&mdash;Roman graves, cremations, and
funeral feasts, which had been washed down and re-arranged by floods.
But these and similar theories, based on the supposition that they
were the abodes of the dead, were not in harmony with the domestic
character of the pottery and implements turned up. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
starting-point of a long series of researches which have now cleared
up the problem was the announcement by Professor Strobel of Parma,
in 1861 (B. 44), that the remains of a palafitte, analogous to those
found in lakes and marshes, were to be seen below the true terramara
deposits at Castione dei Marchesi.</p>

<p>This celebrated and best known of all these settlements is situated
about four miles north-west of Borgo San Donino, in the province of
Parma. It was discovered about seventy years ago, and continued to be
excavated solely for agricultural purposes till 1861, when Gastaldi's
publications directed attention to the prehistoric remains of North
Italy. Till then the numerous objects of human industry disinterred
by the workmen excited little or no curiosity. Things, however, were
very different after the northern wave of archæological inquiry, now
greatly quickened by the discovery of the Swiss lake-dwellings, had
reached the Parmensian antiquaries. Henceforth instructions went
forth from the proprietor, Sig. Ugolotti, that these objects were
to be carefully preserved, and now they constitute a special and
most interesting collection in the Archæological Museum at Parma.
On visiting Castione one sees a slight elevation rising about 10
feet above the plain and surmounted by a church and convent. These
buildings, which are both lofty and extensive, are approached on the
west side by a stone bridge, spanning a canal-like pool of stagnant
water, which lies along the margin of the mound and partly surrounds
it. Elsewhere the slope from this plateau to the level plain is
gradual, except where the more recent excavations have been made,
which present much the same appearance as a roadside sand-pit. Of the
original size and form of the mound it is now difficult to form a
correct estimate, owing to the amount of stuff yearly carted away, but
the portion still undisturbed or covered by buildings may be estimated
at two acres.</p>

<p>A perpendicular section, which can be readily obtained at various
points, presents the following succession of layers from above
downwards:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Ordinary mould or disturbed soil for a depth of 6 feet,
said to contain Roman and more recent remains.</p>

<p>2. The terramara beds proper, arranged in thin, wavy
laminations of variously-coloured earths. Sometimes a thickish
bed of clay or a black band of charcoal catches the eye; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
another place an overlapped bed is seen to shelve out and
disappear altogether. But, notwithstanding a wavy or undulating
appearance, the general horizontality of these layers is maintained.
Their average total thickness amounts to 8 feet.</p>

</div>

<p>3. Underneath these beds lies a blackish peaty substance,
some 3 feet thick, in which, as already mentioned, Strobel
detected the remains of a palafitte.</p>

<p>Below this peaty stratum there is a greenish clayey deposit,
similar in composition to that found at some depth in the
surrounding plain, into which the piles were driven.

<p>Strobel's discovery caused much speculative interest, especially
when correlated with the researches initiated by Gastaldi regarding
lake-and pile-dwellings, the existence of which in Italy had just
been demonstrated at Mercurago and Lake Garda.</p>

<p>Reflecting on these novel revelations and impelled, no doubt, by
the growing interest in such studies, Strobel and Pigorini, both then
residing at Parma, commenced a series of observations and inquiries
regarding the terremare in their vicinity, the outcome of which
was a joint report, first published in 1862 as part of Gastaldi's
well-known article, "Nuovi cenni sugli oggetti di alta antichità
trovati nelle torbiere e nelle mariniere dell' Italia." (B. 52.)

In this report the authors discussed the works of man found in the
marl-beds under the following five heads&mdash;viz. habitations,
vessels, utensils, arms, and things of uncertain use. The pottery
they recognised as having degrees of quality according to the uses to
which the vessels were put. The larger vases were roughly kneaded, the
grains of sand were larger and more visible, and the colour of the
paste was ash-black inside and reddish outside. They had no glaze.
The smaller dishes were made of fine homogeneous paste, with very
thin walls, smooth surface, and a blackish surface approaching to
varnish. According to their form they might be divided into a great
many varieties, as plates, cups, basins, bottles, vases, etc.
(<a href="#Fig_68_a"><b>Fig. 68</b><i>a</i></a>). In the makers of this pottery
the authors recognised an inclination to vary their handiworks, and this was
especially manifested in the various forms and different embellishments of the
handles, called <i>appendiculati</i>, which turned up in large quantities.
These were ordinary handles with an addition on the top, either in
the form of an upright button-like process or transverse bar. To the
latter the greatest interest was attached, as the ends of the bars
were bent in a variety of ways so as to assume the form of ears or
horns as in <a href="#Fig_68_b"><b>Fig. 68</b><i>b</i></a>.</p>

<p>Among the utensils they distinguished a variety of industrial
objects such as needles, pins, ornamented combs, small wheels,
handles, etc., made of bone or horn (<a href="#Fig_69"><b>Figs. 69</b> to <b>74</b></a>).
Of stone there were numbers of rubbers, corn-grinders, and grooved
spheroidal stones (<b><a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a></b>), but very few hatchets and
chisels.</p>

<p>Of bronze they found sickles (<b><a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a></b>), spear-heads
(<b><a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a></b>), flat celts (<b><a href="#Fig_78">Fig. 78</a></b>),
awls (<b><a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79</a></b>), chisels, pins, etc.</p>

<p>Among the objects of uncertain use were classified a series of
spindle-whorls of different forms (<b><a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a></b>).</p>

<p>From the existence of metal slag and stone moulds (<b><a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a></b>)

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and other organic remains, to which I shall afterwards refer when
treating of his subsequent investigations in this wide and important
field of research.</p>

<p>In summing up, the authors used the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"As to the first <i>origin</i> of the <i>marl-earths</i>,
it is clear that the banquets, as you assert, are a considerable part;
but there seems to us to appear in the scoriæ, the millstones, the
heaps of grain, the palisades, the potsherds, already cited, together
with the arms and utensils of all sorts which are found in these
earths, something more than a mere meeting-place to banquet. It seems
to us, if we do not err, that there is something of settlement and
duration. Man did not meet there only to arrange and devour the feast,
but to employ himself besides in domestic avocations, in preparing
implements and arms, to sew garments, and make nets&mdash;in a word,
to inhabit them; besides, to exercise the practices of their religious
worship, and, perhaps, also to burn their dead, and all these after
the fashion of barbarians, such as the people of the <i>marl-beds</i>
must have been. These people, according to the place and time, were
fishermen, hunters, shepherds, and even agriculturists." (B. 91, p. 83.)</p>

<p>These words contain the most important feature of this report.
The authors, though not absolutely free from the previous notions
that floods and inundations had something to do with the stratification
of the <i>débris</i>, distinctly recognise that the terremare must
be considered as the remains of the <i>habitations of the living</i>, and
not, as hitherto supposed, the resting-places of the dead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Interest in the whole subject now rapidly increased, and
extended to agriculturists and local observers. Yearly excavations
were carefully scanned and even special researches were carried
on in the interests of science. Strobel, a professed naturalist
with remarkably precise and accurate habits, devoted his great
energies to the elucidation of the organic remains, especially the
rich and varied products of the peaty bed (<i>terra uliginosa</i>) at
Castione, in which the piles were detected. Pigorini, on the other
hand, was an archæologist pure and simple, but endowed with great
ability and much fertility in the correlation and generalisation
of facts&mdash;qualities which have since gained him the chair of
archæology at Rome, which he now fills with so much distinction.
Thus associated these two men may be said to have developed a new
school of archæology, especially anent the terremare, having as its
primary and indispensable object the collection of authenticated data,
without which, they asserted, no deductions however brilliant could
be scientific.</p>

<p>In the course of researches conducted by Strobel at Castione,
during the years 1862 and 1863, he observed that the piles were
placed in a sort of basin, either natural or artificial; that they
supported transverse beams over which clay floorings had been placed;
and that they were more thickly set towards the margin, and slanting,
as if to strengthen the inner superstructures. Moreover, he proved
that the supposed peaty formation (<i>terra uliginosa</i>) had nothing
in common with true peat, but was simply a subaqueous deposit of
ordinary earth, associated with decomposed organic <i>débris</i>. Another
terramara in Parma having similar characteristics to that at Castione
was investigated in the following year by Pigorini, and thus the
theory of an occasional palafitte converted into a land-dwelling
seemed to them to be confirmed. Previous to this the stratification
of the beds&mdash;one of the most remarkable features of these
deposits&mdash;had not excited any unusual surprise, but now it
began to be commented upon.</p>

<p>These and some other noteworthy observations here and there
coming to light induced Strobel and Pigorini to issue a second
report on the terremare of Parma. (B. 89.) But in this
<i>brochure</i>, which appeared in 1864, there does not appear to be
any striking departure from the views expressed by the authors
in their previous report. They asserted that the people who
constructed and inhabited these dwellings were a nomadic or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
agricultural race, belonging to the Bronze Age, and were probably
allied to the Swiss lake-dwellers; and that their habitations
varied in structural character according to the exigencies of
the site chosen. No significance was attached to the piles at
Castione and elsewhere, beyond supplying a proof that different
methods of construction had been in use, the adoption of
which depended on local conditions. The composition of the
strata as "earthy beds, now ashy, now yellowish, now reddish
or black," and their peculiarly wavy arrangement, were supposed
to mark merely a variety.</p>

<p>The terremare now became a controversial focus between the
adherents of the old and new schools. To the former Cavedoni, Coppi,
and subsequently Crespellani, lent their influence; while the latter
were reinforced by Boni, Canestrini, Calegari, and Chierici. Amongst
all these, during the next few years, Chierici stood pre-eminent.
Already an ardent collector of the antiquities of his native country,
he found in the mysterious terremare a congenial field and a new
outlet for his love of practical research. For minute observation and
lucid exposition of the phenomena observed in explorations, Chierici
had few superiors. To him must undoubtedly be assigned the next great
contributions towards the elucidation of the terremare problem.
Observing in several instances that an earthy dyke of a rectangular
shape, with a ditch outside, surrounded the terramara mound, and
that upright beams, or traces of them, were to be seen in all parts
of the deposits, he suggested that these were normal features in
their structure. Although some of his contemporary explorers had
incidentally noticed piles in a stratum different from that in which
their original discovery was made at Castione, and even recorded
the fact (B. 407, p. 7), it remained to Chierici alone to interpret
the true significance of the discovery. In support of the theory of
universality of the palafitte system, he showed that in many cases
the piles had entirely disappeared by decomposition, and that the
only traces of their existence were the holes they had occupied. Some
of these, indeed, had subsequently become filled up by infiltrated
matter, so that on section they presented the appearance of inverted
cones. On this point he relates that in one space measuring 210 square
metres he counted no less than 124 "buche di pali." (B. 206, p. 9.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be remembered that, previous to this, archæologists
had no clear notion of the order or relative position of the
products of different ages and races, and the same confusion
extended to the terremare. For instance, at Castelnuovo, Chierici
seemed puzzled at finding, underneath a Bronze Age terramara,
indications of an older period. At Campeggine, on the other
hand, objects of the early Iron Age appeared, but chiefly in the
upper strata, while Etruscan remains had been recognised in
several instances.</p>

<p>Another point to which Chierici's attention was directed was
the frequency with which rectangular enclosures were disposed
so as to have their four sides facing the cardinal points; and
this orientation within certain limits, varying, it would seem,
according to the direction of the sunrise when the settlement
was founded, he considered also applicable to all the terramara
villages. On this point see also Helbig. (B. 308.)</p>

<p>In his famous theory of the structure of the terramara villages (B.
206) Chierici conceived the idea that they had been constructed over
artificial basins to which a running stream was made to flow so as to
convert the <i>bacino</i> into a pool of water. This pool was surrounded
by an earthen dyke inside of which a wooden platform was erected on
piles and covered with a layer of clay. Huts were then erected over
this platform at regular intervals, and the refuse from them was
thrown, by means of holes here and there, into the space below. The
water entering at one side of the enclosure made its exit at the
opposite side. Thus the space below the platform was more or less
occupied with water, and the <i>débris</i> thrown into it became arranged
into sedimentary strata, and so continued to accumulate until the
entire space was filled up. When the accumulation of <i>débris</i> reached
this extent it became necessary to elevate their floorings, and this
was done by repeating the same process at a higher level; and in this
manner Chierici accounted for the successive platforms and palafittes
which were to be met with in the terramara beds.</p>

<p>Thus in the hands of Chierici almost every feature of the
terramara deposits excited fresh interest and an eagerness for
further inquiries. Piles or their traces were found almost immediately
in all the stations wherever they were carefully looked
for. In 1872 Chierici and Mantovani explored two stations, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
at Monte Venere and the other at Monte, in which were found not
only the dyke surrounding the basin and palafitte, but, in one of
them, three series of piles, one superimposed above the other, thus
clearly showing that when the spaces around the piles and underneath
the platform had got filled up with <i>débris</i>, a second palafitte
had been resorted to, which in its turn had been succeeded by a
third. (B. 233 and 247.) It was on all hands acknowledged that
in many parts the peculiar stratification of the layers in certain
beds could only be accounted for on the supposition that water had
somehow to do with the sorting of their ingredients, as floating
materials, such as bits of charcoal, were often eliminated and formed
separate layers. So far Chierici's theory might be taken as offering
a complete explanation of the phenomena. But the deposition of
the higher portions of the mound remained to be accounted for,
as it was difficult to conceive of pools of water at the requisite
heights. A still more formidable objection was the impossibility
of transporting water without the intervention of a system of
hydraulics to sites placed on elevations far above the level of
any adjacent streams, and of this class several had been known, as
at Monte Venere, Roteglia, Castellaccio, etc. (B. 407, p. 9); yet, in
most cases, they also contained the palafitte and dyke. This was
the weakest part of the theory and found few supporters, but in
other respects every additional discovery only tended to confirm it.
Strobel, however, declined to believe in the universality of either
dykes or palafittes. Thus, writing in 1874 (B. 267), he says: "At
the conclusion of an article which I wrote in 1872 on shells of
<i>Unio</i> found in the marière, etc., I asserted that the terremare, those
prehistoric settlements, were terrestrial; that in some of them man
lived in pile-dwellings on dry ground, in others he dwelt in tents
or huts; and that in some of the terramara beds earthworks can be
seen, which may have been used as dykes or bulwarks, and which
in all probability were fortified with ditches." After showing how
impossible it would be for the terramaricoli of Roteglia and
Castellaccio to have pools of water at such an elevation as they had
been, he goes on to say: "And here I may be permitted to raise my
voice against those who imagine that prehistoric men, and more
especially those of the marière, and of our terremare and pile-dwellings
of the Bronze Age, always and everywhere followed
constantly one uniform and invariable order in arranging their
abodes, as if they were inferior to the animals, nay, even to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
invertebrates, who modify their constructions according to circumstances.
But, in fact, there is much less uniformity in these
terremare than is often found in the dwellings of animals; therefore
I maintain logically, that even prehistoric men changed their mode
of living according to place, time, and circumstances; and that the
terramaricoli did not live solely in pools of water, as some assert,
but had settlements both in the water and on dry land, and that
the terramara beds are the results of the latter. In some of the terrestrial
settlements they probably had pile-dwellings, while in others
they lived in huts or tents. Some at least of the land settlements
were defended by dykes and ditches." (B. 119, 2nd ed., p. 402.)</p>

<p>Pigorini, on the other hand, looked favourably on the major
portion of Chierici's generalisations, and in the course of explorations
conducted by him at Casaroldo in 1874 (B. 266 and 297) he
found everything not only in harmony with his views but some
additional facts that seemed to strengthen that portion of his
theory in which he maintained that the palafitte was the normal
method adopted in the structure of the terremare, whatever the
nature of the locality might be in which they were constructed.
Thus at Casaroldo, although there was both a ditch and a dyke
surrounding the basin containing the palafitte, it had no peaty
understratum (<i>terra uliginosa</i>), as at Castione, but a substance
precisely identical with the superimposed deposits. Here also
there were traces of piles on a higher level.</p>

<p>Almost coincident with the publication of Chierici's theory of
the terremare, in 1871, was the International Congress of Anthropology
and Prehistoric Archæology at Bologna, which gave an immense
impetus to such studies. Indeed, the decade which followed
may be characterised as the Augustan age in the department of
prehistoric archæology in Italy. The remarkable discoveries in the
old cemeteries of Bologna, and in Etruscan tombs elsewhere in the
Circumpadana district, together with the increasing number of
prehistoric stations in lakes, turbaries, caverns, etc., greatly widened
the field of research and added to the difficulty of deciphering,
from amidst the endless overlappings of their remains, the history
of the various civilisations which formerly characterised the country.
In order to facilitate these studies the <i>Bullettino Paletnologia
Italiana</i> was established at the commencement of 1875, under the
joint editorship of Chierici, Pigorini, and Strobel. This periodical
has done much good and is still in a flourishing condition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS AT CASTIONE.</h3>

<p>Such was the general tenor of the opinions in regard to the
terremare up to 1877, when, owing to the interest then taken in
these singular remains and with the view of clearing up some of
the contested points, the Minister of Public Instruction ordered a
fresh excavation to be made at Castione under the superintendence
of Professor Pigorini. The portion selected was an oblong space at
the north side of the church, beginning at the margin and stretching
inwards for a considerable distance. The result of this was the
disclosure of a new and remarkable feature in its structural
arrangement. At the inside of the earthen dyke, and intervening
between it and a forest of piles which extended towards the interior,
was a series of small rectangular enclosures constructed of horizontal
beams laid one above the other. These enclosures, which extended side
by side like a string of log-houses, formed an abrupt facing to the
dyke. The beams were roughly hewn, and partially mortised into each
other at the points of crossing, from which their ends projected
irregularly, some even extending from one compartment to the next.
Inside these log-houses there was nothing but rubbish&mdash;clay,
gravel, bits of wood, etc.&mdash;packed firmly together. But it is
needless to enter upon all the details of this curious structure;
suffice it to say that Pigorini came to the conclusion that their
purpose was to support the inside of the earthen dyke (<i>contrafforte
dell' argine</i>). The piles were in rows about two feet apart, and each
pile was separated from its neighbour by an interval of one foot.
When the space was cleared there was quite a forest of these piles,
and it is noteworthy that they were all inclined in one direction,
viz. north-east, a fact which is well shown in the first of the two
photographic illustrations here given (<b><a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a></b>).</p>

<p>From an examination of the composition of the soil outside the
limits of the station Pigorini ascertained that the bluish clay bed
forming the subsoil of the terramara mound corresponded to what was
the surface of the surrounding plain when the terramaricoli founded
their settlement, and that the thick mass of alluvial yellowish clay
in which the mound is now partially buried has been subsequently deposited.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Other interesting details are given in Pigorini's exhaustive and
admirable report regarding the structure of the ditch, dyke,
platforms, hearths, etc., and the peculiarity and composition of the
strata. But these the limits at my disposal in this work compel me to
pass over, and I must be content with quoting the following summary of
his conclusions in regard to the origin of the station:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The terramaricoli having arrived at the place now called Castione
dei Marchesi did not select for their encampment a low-lying spot
subject to inundations, but the top of a slight elevation of bluish
clay not yet covered with the more recent alluvial deposits. The space
measured out for the station was of a rectangular shape and covered
about a couple of acres. This area they surrounded with a ditch, the
excavated soil being thrown to the inside and so they formed a dyke
6 feet in height, which consequently enclosed a <i>bacino</i> having its
base on the original soil of the plain. The area thus defined had an
orientated position with a deviation of 30° from east to north.</p>

<p>"Having completed the surrounding ditch and dyke, the next step
was to construct along the inner margin of the dyke a series of
log-houses, bound together and filled with <i>débris</i>, over which they
finally laid a gravel pavement. The main object of this elaborate
structure was to support the earthen dyke. Next they planted all over
the <i>bacino</i> rows of piles at regular intervals, whose tops reached
to the level of the surface of the <i>contrafforte</i>, and over them they
laid horizontal planks of wood which, in certain places, were covered
with beds of clay (<i>tavole coperte d'argilla</i>).</p>

<p>"On this platform were constructed the huts of the people.
The exact form of these huts has not been ascertained, but they
were certainly made of wood, straw and clay, no other material
having been used either at Castione or any other terramara. The
village was now complete, and the inhabitants, in the course of
their domestic avocations, threw the refuse of food and other
<i>débris</i> into the space below, probably by means of holes, which
gradually accumulated until the space became completely filled up.</p>

<p>"When this stage was reached the people did not change their chosen
site, but proceeded to erect a new palafitte above the old one. They
elevated the dyke by extending its base, placed new <i>contrafforte</i>
along its inner side superimposed on the older ones, and thus
continued to convert the surface of the first platform into the base
of the new <i>bacino</i>. Here they repeated the operation of planting it
with piles, and over these a new platform and huts were erected, which
were occupied as before, until the accumulation of <i>débris</i> again
drove the inhabitants to construct a third dwelling-place at a still
higher level." (B. 407, p. 44.)

<h3>MONTALE.</h3>

<p>Another instructive station, which I visited along with the
distinguished archæologist, Sig. Crespellani, is that at Montale, a
few miles south of Modena. Here the elevation of the mound is more
marked than at Castione, as the entire mass stands clear above the
surrounding plain, and, like it, the central part is occupied by a
church and some other religious buildings. The discovery of this
terramara was not made till 1868, but, its contents being readily
accessible, the progress of its demolition has been rapid. In 1871
it was selected as the most suitable to be visited by the members of
the International Congress, and, for their special benefit, a new
section was then opened up. The annual explorations conducted in this
mound, of course regulated by agricultural demands, are now entirely
in the hands of the authorities of the Museo Civico at Modena, who
appropriate all rare objects for the enhancement of their large and
valuable prehistoric collection. The director of the Museum, Sig.
Boni, publishes, from time to time, a report of the excavations and of
the results obtained. (B. 380 and 421.)</p>

<p>According to Boni, the area of the mound, including the dyke,
was 9,000 square mètres (about 2 acres), of which about 4,000 are
occupied by the ecclesiastical buildings already referred to. Of the
remaining space available for explorations about one half has been
cleared away. On the north side of the church, just on the verge
of the pit where the workmen were riddling and preparing the
saleable stuff, stood an enormous chestnut tree, whose roots could
be seen below the grassy surface projecting from the perpendicular
face of the section. The priest, whose house forms part of the
ecclesiastical buildings on the mound, soon joined our party, and
expatiated on the fabulous age of this tree, but which Crespellani
reduced to something like 150 or 200 years. The entire height of
the section here exposed would be from 15 to 20 feet, the upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
five of which consisted of mouldy soil, which has, of course, to be
removed before the commercially valuable stuff is reached. In
the course of the removal of this upper stratum the following
objects were found, viz. an iron hatchet, fragments of a spur,
several keys, and some much corroded coins of the Old Empire.
The remains of fifteen human burials were also encountered, three
of which had the bodies enclosed in cists made of large bricks.
Indeed, some large tiles, apparently part of a sepulchre, were still
to be seen protruding from a part of this layer. Near one of
the unenclosed burials lay a terra-cotta lamp and a bone comb
with a double row of teeth. Sunk into the upper part of the
terramara beds was a primitive lime-kiln, "evidently," says Boni,
"introduced into the <i>cumulo marnoso</i> at a later period than its
formation." (B. 386, p. 13.)</p>

<p>The great depth of this upper bed of mould, which exists in all the
terremare, is very remarkable and most puzzling to archæologists. Boni
thinks it was spread over the mound at some posterior time, either
for agricultural purposes, or as hygienic precautions, or perhaps
from motives of respect to the supposed sacred character of its
contents.</p>

<p>All the rest of the section was terramara proper, whose contorted
and wave-like beds could readily be distinguished. Sticking in the
face of the section were innumerable fragments of black pottery,
broken bones, and bits of charcoal. All the stuff, before being
disposed of, was passed through riddles, and what remained was thrown
aside as useless rubbish, the heaps of which could only be estimated
by cart-loads. The riddlings consisted almost entirely of broken
pottery, among which were occasional clay weights and more frequently
spindle-whorls, together with the bones and horns of animals,
many of which were converted into implements. Bronze objects were
comparatively rare.</p>

<p>Part of a large earthen dyke which is supposed to have surrounded
the entire mound is still left exposed on the north side. It measured
from 20 to 30 feet in breadth at the base and 11&frac12; feet in
height. Boni, in his description of this dyke, states that a section
which ought to be conical is not so, but more slanting on the outside;
also, at the inner side, its contents are occasionally seen to overlap
the terramara beds. From this and some other structural details he
adduces evidence to show that the dyke had been subsequently added
to by the terramaricoli during their occupation of the settlement.
Bearing in mind what Pigorini says about Castione, the significance of
these observations will be readily perceived.

<h3>CASALE ZAFFANELLA.</h3>

<p>Another typical example of the terremare, which I wish to describe
shortly, lies 1&frac14; mile north of the Po, near the town of
Viadana. This station was accidentally discovered a few years ago
by the brothers Pietro and Giacomo Tassoni, the peasant proprietors
of a field in which they were making trenches for planting vines.
In the course of their operations they dug up fragments of pottery,
which they brought to the Arciprete Antonio Parazzi of Viadana
(already widely known as a skilled archæologist and the founder of an
excellent museum of the local antiquities of the district). Some of
the fragments of pottery turned out to be Roman, while others were
undoubtedly pre-Roman, and this led to a preliminary investigation of
the locality, in which the experienced eye of Parazzi soon detected
the site of a terramara dwelling. A full report of the subsequent
excavations and results obtained was published by Parazzi in the
<i>Bullettino</i> for 1886 (B. 451)&mdash;a monograph which is a perfect
model of the descriptive details of an investigation conducted on
scientific methods.</p>

<p>First of all let me emphasise the fact that there was here
no mound at all. The field was quite flat, and to reach the
surface of the terramara beds a stratum of considerable thickness,
varying from 1 to 2 feet, of the ordinary alluvial deposits
had to be passed through. The terramara beds then continued
for a depth of 8 or 10 feet, underneath which came the subsoil
on which the settlement was originally constructed. It is
noteworthy that in one part of the area, underneath the
terramara beds proper, a peaty bed, similar to that at Castione,
was discovered. To make the resemblance still more striking,
this <i>terra uliginosa</i> also contained the remains of a palafitte.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
These piles were very well preserved, and some of them may now
be seen in the Museum at Viadana.</p>

<p>It was impossible, without enormous labour, to explore this
settlement to a great extent; but by a few well-directed trenches
Parazzi ascertained that it was of a quadrangular shape, and
orientated to within 11 degrees, and that it was surrounded by a ditch
and a dyke. The enclosure, exclusive of the area of the dyke, had a
superficial area of about one English acre. Its four sides measured,
respectively, 208 (N.), 218 (S.), 227 (W.), and 237 (E.) feet. The
dyke was 26 feet broad at its base, and 11 feet 6 inches high, and
showed that it had been added to on three different occasions. Its
inner edge appeared to have been very steep, a fact which suggests
that, as at Castione, there had been some kind of support to prevent
the earth from falling in. The ditch was 34 feet wide, and its maximum
depth was 6&frac12; feet.</p>

<p>The underlying peaty stratum, containing the piles, occupied much
of Parazzi's attention, and he goes largely into its minutiæ. One
curious fact which he records is that the dyke passed over its middle,
leaving a considerable portion of the <i>terra torbosa</i> and palafitte
outside the area of the terramara deposits. This undoubtedly suggests
the idea that the palafitte existed prior to the terramara settlement.
From the character of the relics we shall, however, see that both
belonged to the same age and people.</p>

<p>On the surface of the terramara beds Roman remains were largely
met with, and in one place they came upon a rectangular excavation,
measuring 18 square mètres, containing ordinary earth, bricks, tiles,
fragments of jars, and other Roman pottery. When this was cleared out
there was found at the bottom, at a depth of 7 feet 6 inches, a Roman
pavement, and the stratified terramara layers could be distinctly seen
in the perpendicular walls. Clearly this cellar was constructed long
after the deposition of the terramara beds.</p>

<p>Nor is the settlement of Casale Zaffanella a solitary example
in the Viadana district. Already Parazzi has prepared a large map
of the neighbourhood, which finds a suitable position on the wall of
his museum, with no less than 12 terramara stations marked on it.
Among these there is one Cogozzo (B. 372b) situated about one-and-a-quarter
mile from the town and within 200 yards of the Po,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
which presents the same features as that at Casale Zaffanella, and
also contains traces of a palafitte. Its area is an orientated quadrangle
covering about an acre, but it is completely buried in mud, its
highest point being 31 inches below the surface. It is surrounded
by a ditch and dyke; and, moreover, the inner edge of the dyke was
found to be almost perpendicular, showing that originally it must
have had some kind of <i>contrafforte</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the objects from this group of terramara stations,
now deposited in the Viadana Museum, are represented in
<b><a href="#Fig_86">Fig. 86</a></b>, Nos. 1 to 13.</p>

<h3>GORZANO (MODENA).</h3>

<p>The old-school views advocated by Dr. Coppi, viz. that the
terremare were remains of funeral pyres (<i>roghi</i>), so much biassed his
mind that for many years he appeared to have paid little attention to
the significance of the strata, and consequently the first two volumes
of his magnificently illustrated monograph on the terramara settlement
at Gorzano (B. 207 and 261) lose much of their value from having
the objects of different ages indiscriminately mixed. This defect
is so far removed in the third volume that he divides the deposits
into upper and lower, corresponding to the historic and prehistoric
periods. But, notwithstanding this defect in Dr. Coppi's earlier
works, his investigations are of considerable scientific value, as
his numerous matter-of-fact observations are strictly to be depended on.</p>

<p>The accompanying plan and sections of Gorzano will convey some idea
of the position of the terramara beds in respect to their immediate
surroundings. The deposits (marked c on section A) extended in length
about 90 to 100 mètres from north to south, and 70 mètres in breadth,
with an average thickness of 3&frac12; mètres. The settlement was
constructed on a natural elevation, rising about 9 mètres above the
rest of the plain and 11 above the bed of the adjacent stream Tiepido.
It was surrounded by a ditch and a dyke, and it also contained the
remains of a palafitte. The existence of piles is clearly proved by
Dr. Coppi himself, who gives a section (C) showing their respective
positions, but at the same time he denies that they indicate the
remains of a palafitte.</p>

<p>Of the comparative frequency of industrial remains in the terramara
deposits, a correct notion will be got from a study of Dr.
Coppi's report of the excavations at Gorzano during the year 1875.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
In this year there were 274 cubic mètres excavated, covering an
area of 180 square mètres; and from this mass of <i>débris</i> there were
collected 3,051 objects, of which 173 belonged to the upper or
Romano-mediæval stratum, which varied from 1 to 1&frac12; mètres
in thickness. The rest of the objects, which came from the under
strata, and were reckoned prehistoric, are thus classified:&mdash;852
industrial objects, 1,544 remains of vertebrate animals, 285 remains
of molluscs, 153 vegetable remains.</p>

<p class="space-above1">The 852 industrial remains are again thus assigned:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;50 objects: viz. eight pins, four axes, 12 daggers,
one chisel, two awls, six discs, one spindle-whorl, two fragments of
sickles, and 14 diverse bits.</p>

<p><i>Bone.</i>&mdash;80 objects: viz. 38 needles and pins (of which 23
are entire), nine spatulæ, 17 pointers, three chisels, six teeth, one
lamina, five awls, and one handle.</p>

<p><i>Horn.</i>&mdash;62 objects: viz. seven small wheels, one cylinder,
one comb, two arrow-points, 17 spatulæ, 12 pointers, two awls, three
ornaments, two picks, four handles, and 17 diverse pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
<i>Stone.</i>&mdash;68 objects: viz. two flint
knives, two pendants, four spindle-whorls, two discs, four weights,
six grinding-stones, one polisher, three flint nodules, four flint
flakes, and 30 worked stones.</p>

<p><i>Terracotta.</i>&mdash;585 objects: viz. 494 spindle-whorls
(<b><a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a></b>, No. 17), two cylinders, 12 weights,
68 vases, three covers, five percolators, and one small animal figure.</p>

<p>The bones capable of being determined represented the following
animals:&mdash;15 oxen, 25 sheep or goats, seven stags, eight roes,
30 pigs, two wild boars, 14 dogs or wolves, one cat, eight birds, one
tortoise, and 15 toads.</p>

<p>The industrial remains from the upper stratum were as
follows:&mdash;The central part of a Byzantine crucifix, one lamp, two
fibulæ, three rings of bronze, 12 spindle-whorls of terra-cotta (of
which four were glazed), one spindle-whorl of amber, one spindle-whorl
of glass, two spindle-whorls of talc; of iron there were 20 darts,
two lance-heads, eight knives, seven keys, one lock, eight buckles,
one horseshoe, one bullock-shoe, and 11 undetermined fragments; five
fragments of glass vessels; one sword-handle of wood with bronze
mountings; four bronze fragments; 25 pieces of pottery (three with
potters mark); a small basin of brick; 52 coins (of which 46 were
together); and some slag, etc.</p>

<p>The objects in the upper stratum were mostly associated with
the Oratorio di S. Alberto, built about the early part of the
seventeenth century, and other mediæval buildings now entirely
demolished. It was found to have been built over a still older
church, which dated from the third century. A few of the coins
were Roman of about the same date, but the largest number
dated from the end of the twelfth or commencement of the
thirteenth century, and a few were of still later date. There was
also a Christian cemetery found containing a number of skeletons.</p>

<p>In 1879 Coppi published (B. 340) an account of further discoveries,
and among other objects he describes several stone moulds (10 for
pins, five for lance-heads, and seven for daggers), a stone weapon of
nephrite, two flint knives, a weight of white marble, etc. Of bronze
there are 12 pins, three needles, 20 dagger-blades, five chisels, nine
awls, and a small wheel ornamented with <i>graffiti</i>, besides a quantity
of other objects of horn, bone, pottery, etc.</p>

<p>In 1885 the workmen came upon a grave embedded in the
virgin soil underneath the terramara beds, and supposed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
anterior to their formation. It was constructed of small unhewn
stones, and the space enclosed measured 5 feet 10&frac12; inches long,
1 foot broad, and 1 foot deep. This grave contained a human skeleton
which lay on the right side with the head towards the east, and along
with it were found a spatula of staghorn, fragments of fossil shells,
and some bits of carbonised vegetable matter. (Crespellani, "Scavi del
Modenese," 1886, p. 11.)</p>

<p>A few of the bronze objects from Gorzano are illustrated on

<h3>GENERAL REMARKS ON THE TERRAMARA SETTLEMENTS.</h3>

<p>In the above sketch of the progress of scientific research into
the terremare I have selected four typical examples for special
description. We have seen that in one, viz. Montale, accumulated
<i>débris</i> stood as a clear mound on the surface of the surrounding
plain, while that of Gorzano rested on a natural hillock. The
Castione deposits also assumed the same form, but in this case the
mound was only partially above the plain, the rest being buried in
it. The tops of the piles found in its peaty stratum (<i>terra uliginosa</i>)
were on an average 3 feet below the level of the present surface of
the surrounding plain, and the lowest portion of this bed was a
couple of feet still lower. In the fourth example, Casale Zaffanella,
there was no mound at all visible, but on examination the remains
of the settlement were found to be precisely similar to those of the
others, only the mound was completely buried, as it were, in a sea
of hardened mud.</p>

<p>The explanation of this will be readily perceived when we
remember that the amount of submergence respectively shown in
these instances is in the inverse ratio to their distance from the
lower parts of the plain and its great water channels. The yearly
inundations of the Po and its tributaries extend far and wide, each
time leaving a film of mud, by the repetition of which, in the course
of ages, the surface of the plain has become considerably elevated.
Thus, the increase of silt since the terramara settlement of Casale
Zaffanella was founded, amounts to 12&frac12; feet&mdash;a depth sufficient
to cover the highest part of the mound. It is difficult to say how
much this levelling up process is accountable for the scarcity of
these stations in the lower parts of the Po valley. That they existed,
however, in close proximity to the river is amply proved by those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
stations at Viadana, as well as one or two others, for example, at
Brescello, in the Parmensian district, on the south side of the river.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Formerly the terramara deposits were
supposed to be peculiar to the middle reaches of Parma, Reggio, and
Modena; but later discoveries have upset this generalisation, as
they are now shown to have a much wider distribution, embracing
the provinces on both sides of the Po. (See Sketch Map, <a href="#Map_11">page 266</a>.)</p>

<p class="space-above1">Dr. Giacometti first (1868) directed attention to
the terramara deposits in the province of Mantua, and showed their similarity
to those of Emilia. A few miles north-east of the town of Mantua
there was found a group of seven or eight stations, regarding one of
which, Bigarello, he stated that it contained the same kind of pottery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
and the same forms of stone implements as that at Castelnuovo in
Emilia, the only difference being in the kind of stone used, the one
being taken from the <i>débris</i> of the Alps and the other from the
Apennines. Among the fragments of pottery he drew particular
attention to the variety of handles, which showed all the transitional
forms from knobs up to the most elegant <i>anse lunate</i>. "Havvene,"
says he, "<i>di bicornute</i>, <i>di lunate</i>, <i>di bitubercolate</i>,
<i>bilanceolate</i>, <i>cincinnate</i>, <i>transverse</i>,
<i>appendiculate</i>, ecc., quasi tutta in somma, la famiglia
designata dal Mortillet ('Les Terramares du Reggianais,'
1865), colla speciale caratteristica di anse lunate."</p>

<p>In 1874 Marinoni gave an interesting account of the prehistoric
remains of the district of Seniga in the province of Brescia, especially
those of the terremare at Chiavichetto and Gottolengo. (B. 265.)
The former, which is the most interesting of a group of seven
stations, is situated in the angle formed by the junction of the
Mella with the Oglia, nearly 20 miles south of the town of Brescia.
In excavating soil for making a dyke the workmen found objects of
human industry&mdash;scrapers and saws of flint, three hatchets of
serpentine, one large stone-adze, various stone rubbers, etc., several
fragments of worked horn, and an extraordinary quantity of broken
pottery. The further objects discovered here were chiefly of stone,
rarely of bronze, and, according to Marinoni, they were very similar
to those from the terramara stations of Bigarello and Pomella to
the east of Mantua.</p>

<p>The station at Gottolengo, discovered in 1871, is situated
five miles to the north of Regona, and on the left bank of the
Mella. Before being disturbed it presented the form of a flattish
mound, which on examination yielded relics similar to those of
the other well-known terremare, of which the following may be
mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p>Upwards of 20 arrow-points&mdash;pedunculated, triangular, or
heart-shaped. Some fragments of polished hatchets of serpentine;
spindle-whorls of terra-cotta (<b><a href="#Fig_86">Fig. 86</a></b>, No. 17):&mdash;one
very large, 4&frac34; inches in diameter (No. 28), was similar to another
found at Chiavichetto. Broken bones, portions of deer-horns, some of
which · were made into daggers and pointers; two bone combs ornamented
with triangular lines and <i>graffitti</i>, similar to those from Castione
and Noceto. An oval cake or ring of wood like the supports for
vases (No. 25). Of bronze there were various tools and implements.
Spear-heads with a tang were most common; No. 19 represents one with
two rivet-holes, a type which was also represented at Chiavichetto. A
double-edged implement still held the rivet which had fixed it to a
handle (No. 22). One arrow-point (No. 23) is similar to one found in
the terramara station at Campeggine in the province of Parma. Several
fragments of pins, wires, spirals, and small plates of bronze. Among
iron objects, all of which were much corroded, was a spear-head (No.
24). Portions of greenish vitreous paste.

and stations on the north side of the Po. No. 3 = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>,

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
The following animals were identified among the osseous
remains:&mdash;stag, ox, goat, sheep, horse, and pig.</p>

<p>Not only as regards the relics but also in internal structure the
terramara stations on the north of the Po have been shown to be
identical with those on the south side. This we have already seen
in the description of Casale Zaffanella. But the point was first
established by the indefatigable researches of Chierici, who, in
1881, along with a few other antiquaries, explored the stations at
Bellanda and Villa Cappella in the commune of Gazzoldo, about
10 miles west of Mantua. Here all the characteristic features of
the terremare&mdash;the surrounding dyke, palafitte, and orientation&mdash;were
clearly established. (B. 372a.)</p>

<p>The best investigated terramara in the Bologna district is that
at Castellaccio, about three-quarters of a mile to the south of
Imola. (B. 457.) The deposits repose on an isolated elevation
on the right bank of the river Santerno, and rising nearly
120 feet above its bed; but on it there are no remains of ancient
stone buildings, as the name would seem to imply. The hill is of
yellowish sand, belonging to the Upper Pliocene. Scarabelli,
who has recently published an illustrated monograph of its
peculiarities and the antiquities found on it, states that piles were
numerous, though many had disappeared by decomposition, only
traces of their holes being then detected. Some of the piles were
large, measuring over a foot in diameter, and they were placed
irregularly. No less than 26 hearths were met with at different
levels, and those on the same level were from 4 to 6&frac12; mètres apart.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of this terramara is that its antiquities would
appear to belong to both the Stone and Bronze Ages. The flint
implements included about 20 roughly-chipped tools like scrapers,
some badly-made arrow-points, and saws resembling those found
in the palafittes in the Mincio. Altogether 216 worked flints and
about 600 chips and cores were collected. Some polished stone
axes, together with four portions of perforated implements.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Among about 120 spindle-whorls of burnt clay there was only
one ornamented. There were various implements of staghorn and
bone, a few of the former being perforated and apparently used
as axe and hammer heads like those from Gorzano. Some perforated
shells are also recorded.</p>

<p>The pottery was precisely similar to that usually found on
the well-known terramara deposits of Emilia, showing various
forms of handles, horn-like projections, perforated knobs, etc.</p>

<p>The total number of bronze articles amounted only to seven
pieces, and included a small sickle, a coltello-ascia like that from
Bosisio (<b><a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a></b>, No. 10), and a small dagger with
two rivets&mdash;the rest being of an undetermined character. Two objects of
<i>pietra ollare</i> (a small spindle-whorl and a dish turned on the wheel)
and a bronze buckle were found among the disturbed beds on the surface.</p>

<p>Beyond the valley of the Po no decided remains of palafittes
or terremare have come to light, and the obscure indications
that have been recorded leave it doubtful whether they are of
a prehistoric character.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Of these the only one worthy of detailed notice here is the dwelling
found near Offida, in the Piceno district (Central Italy), and
described by Professor Pigorini. (B. 343b.)</p>

<p>About one and a half miles from Offida, in a small valley
surrounded by hills, there was formerly a small lake, which has become
drained by the erosion of a stream which falls into the Tresino. Here,
covered with 16 feet of sand and <i>débris</i>, the Marquis Allevi found
a platform 50 yards long, 15 yards wide, and 2 feet thick. Below the
platform there was lake-mud, containing fresh-water shells, to the
depth of 9&frac12; feet, in which were charcoal, bones of animals,
fragments of pottery, and other remains of human occupancy. This
platform was constructed of large trunks deprived of their branches
and laid horizontally at intervals of about four feet, above which
came smaller beams irregularly laid without any order and then a layer
of clay and moss. On this platform were found calcined round stones,
the bottom of a dish, and some 12 fragments of other vessels, some
of fine and some of coarse pottery. One bit had a recurved lip, and
another was ornamented with a kind of zig-zag ornamentation in incised
lines. There were also about 20 pieces of copper, some of which looked
like crucibles.</p>

<p><i>Extent.</i>&mdash;As to the actual dimensions of the terramara mounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
it is difficult to procure accurate measurements, for several reasons.
In many instances they are either built over by modern buildings,
or there is nothing to distinguish their <i>débris</i> from the surrounding
soil without making extensive excavations. Even when the site
is a clearly-defined mound, as at Montale, one estimate may differ
from another according as the area of the surrounding dyke is
or is not included in the measurements. Generally speaking they
are rectangular in form and, according to Chierici, their average
superficial area is about seven acres. (B. 311, p. 105.) But their
respective areas vary very much, as will be seen from the following
stations, in addition to those already given, whose measurements
have been accurately ascertained by competent authorities:&mdash;</p>

<p>Casaroldo (Parma), 200 by 160 by 3·70 mètres. (B. 297, p. 360.)</p>

<p>Parma, 300 by 28 mètres. (Strobel e Pigorini, Seconda Relazione, p. 149.)</p>

<p>Castiglione di Marano (Modena), 114 by 64, and 3 mètres thick.
(B. 422, p. 19.)</p>

<p>Pragatto (Bologna), 200 by 150, and 3 mètres thick. (B. 372, p. 138.)</p>

<p>In his description of Bellanda (Mantua), Chierici observes that
the bacino was a rectangle 96 mètres across, giving an area of about
two acres, to which he adds "ampiezza ordinaria delle terremare."
(B. 372, p. 80.) On the other hand, the two whose measurements have
been accurately given by Parazzi, viz. Cogozzo and Casale Zaffanella,
show a superficial area of only half this size, a fact which induced
Parazzi to observe that the terremare in Viadana seemed to be smaller
than those of Emilia and that at Bellanda. (B. 451, p. 4.)</p>

<p><i>Number.</i>&mdash;The total number of terramara stations in the Po
valley is over 100, which are thus (approximately) distributed among
the provinces:&mdash;Parma, 30; Reggio, 25; Modena, 16; Bologna, 5 or
6; Mantua, about 20; and Brescia, 8.</p>

<p><i>Relics.</i>&mdash;More trustworthy knowledge of the social conditions
and general culture of the terramaricoli is to be derived from a
study of the remains of their villages than if they had come within
the scope of the earliest written records. The ordinary <i>débris</i> here
accumulated, such as the more imperishable portions of food refuse,
stray objects, etc., are arranged in chronological sequence like
geological strata, the more recent being on the surface, and the
oldest at the bottom. Wherever an object of human industry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
happened to drop there it remained, marking in all time coming its
relative place in the duration of the community. The industrial
remains show that these people founded their dwellings in the early
Bronze Age. The existence of a few flint implements and other objects
of the Stone Age is quite in harmony with the usual overlap of the
relics of dying customs in the transition period. That the weaving of
cloth was largely practised by them is proved by the extraordinary
variety and abundance of spindle-whorls and loom-weights. They made
ornamental buttons of terra-cotta, horn, and bone; as well as pins,
combs, and other objects of the latter materials. Wood was also
largely used in the manufacture of a great variety of things, as
handles, dishes, spoons, floorings, etc. (B. 328e.) That they worked
their implements and ornaments of bronze is proved by the number of
foundry objects collected, as bronze slag, stone moulds, etc.
(<b><a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a></b>, Nos. 14 to 17).</p>

<p>We have already seen that the terramaricoli had an extensive
knowledge of the ceramic art. The vessels in daily use were no less
varied and elegant in shape than our modern jugs, teapots, cups,
bowls, basins, saucers, flower-vases, etc. Some had everted rims and
the majority flat bases. The ornamentation consisted of parallel and
wavy ridges, knobs (sometimes perforated), triangles, and crosses
of incised grooves, circular or semicircular impressions, etc. But
most characteristic are the appendages attached to the tops of the
handles (<b><a href="#Fig_84">Fig. 84</a></b>, Nos. 21 and 22), which were of
the most varied and fanciful forms. These remarkable handles are not found on
pottery beyond the area circumscribed by the terremare. Nor is the
fully-developed <i>ansa lunata</i> found in the lake-dwellings within this
area, with the exception of the stations at Peschiera, Mincio and
Il Bor, in the south-east corner of Lake Garda. Rudimentary forms
of these handles, such as those from the lake-dwellings of Polada
(<b><a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a></b>, Nos. 13 and 14), Arquà Petrarca and
Fimon (<b><a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a></b>), are also found in the western
district of the Po valley (<b><a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a></b>, No. 16).
The terremare would, therefore, appear to be
somewhat posterior to the earlier lake-dwellings. But, on the other
hand, the later lake-dwellings (Peschiera and Mincio) were posterior
to the terremare. Not only does the pottery of the palafitte at
Peschiera include the characteristic <i>anse lunate</i> (<b><a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a></b>,
No. 26), but among its bronze relics are examples of almost every
object found in the terremare, as razors, pins, sickles, knives,
etc.&mdash;a fact which will be at once seen from a comparison of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
respective objects here illustrated. (Compare <b><a href="#Fig_63">Figs. 63</a></b>,
<b><a href="#Fig_64">64</a></b>, and <b><a href="#Fig_65">65</a></b>,
with <b><a href="#Fig_83">Figs. 83</a></b>, <b><a href="#Fig_84">84</a></b>,
and <b><a href="#Fig_85">85</a></b>.) Moreover, from this comparison
a further inference will be drawn, viz. that the lake-dwelling remains
contain various objects which are not found in the terremare, as
fibulæ (<b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>, Nos. 8 and 22 to 25), bracelets
(<b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>, Nos. 31 and 32), one-edged knives
(<b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>, No. 11), torques
(<b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>, Nos. 13, 19), etc., all of which are
indisputably of later date than the relics of the terremare proper.</p>

<p><i>Organic Remains</i>.&mdash;The principal food of the terramaricoli
consisted of the produce derived from agricultural and pastoral
farming. An exhaustive analysis of their vegetable remains has not
yet been made; but, from the occasional stores of grain, chiefly
in a carbonised state, and other provisions met with, they are
believed to have been in the habit of eating the following seeds
and fruits:&mdash;wheat (two varieties), beans, millet, acorns,
beech-nuts, apples, pears, sloes, cornel-cherries, brambles,
pistachio-nuts (<i>Staphylea pinnata</i>), hazel-nuts, and grapes (<i>Vitis
vinifera</i>). Flax was largely cultivated, and its seeds were supposed
to have been used as food, while of course its fibres were converted
into thread, ropes, and cloth. Among the vegetal remains from Casale
Zaffanella submitted to Professor Oreste Mattirolo in Turin, wheat and
both the seeds and wood of the vine were recognised.</p>

<p>As regards the domestic and wild animals on which the terramaricoli
subsisted, we are in possession of more definite information, owing to
the persevering watchfulness of Professor Strobel. The following is

<p>As coming under the category of organic remains I may add that a
great variety of shells, both of living and fossil species, are found
in the terramara deposits. Many of them are perforated, especially
the more ornamental fossil varieties, and were undoubtedly used
as ornaments. Some of the flat shells of bivalves give a tingling
noise when struck, and are therefore supposed to have been used to
produce some kind of musical sound. Land and fresh-water species were
also, no doubt, used as food. Coppi in his monograph (vol. ii. p. 100)
describes and illustrates a variety of the more striking forms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
collected in Gorzano; and, in summing up his list, he states that 479
were of marine origin (either recent or fossil), 388 belonged to
fresh-water species, and 31 were land shells.</p>

<p>From the existence of the horny cases of various kinds of insects,
some living in air and others in water, and their larvæ in various
stages of evolution, Pigorini adduces an argument against the
supposition that the bacino was kept constantly filled with water.
(Strobel, B. 88, p. 18, and 89, p. 36; Pigorini, B. 407, p. 38;
Parazzi, B. 451, p. 54.)</p>

<p>The protracted discussion as to whether or not amber has been
found in the terremare proper was finally settled by the statement of
Pigorini that, in his recent explorations (1877) at Castione, it was
found in the lowest stratum. "Ora siamo certi che l'ambra si trovò in
Castione sepolta nello strato infimo, e colla certezza che vi fosse
penetrata nei giorni in cui lo strato stesso si formava." (B. 407, p. 51.)</p>

<p>As early as 1863 Strobel and Pigorini announced the discovery at
Castione of a couple of amber beads, but as their position in the
<i>débris</i> had not been determined, no inferences could be drawn from
this discovery. In 1871 Coppi found a large one (<i>fusaiuola</i>) at
Gorzano; and later, another of the same kind. One was also found at
Montale, and another at Casinalbo. As these are all the records of
amber up to the decided discovery of Pigorini, it is clear that it was
a very scarce object among the terramaricoli. The number from Montale,
however, now amounts to 16, the largest of which is 1&frac34; inches
in diameter. (B. 279b, 298b, 311a'.)</p>

<p><i>Age.</i>&mdash;In the spring of 1865 Pigorini explored and described
a station in the district of Parma called Fontanellato, which, at the
time, he considered to be a terramara containing a fascine structure
belonging to the Iron Age. (B. 112.) In the excavations which were
conducted here the following different strata were exposed from above
downwards:&mdash;(1) 2 feet of soil; (2) a bed of alluvial deposits 4
inches thick; (3) a bed of materials similar in colour and composition
to those of the ordinary terramara deposits, 1 foot 10 inches thick;
(4) a mass of mixed materials 2 feet 7 inches thick, containing roots,
branches, leaves, etc., mixed with clay, together with pottery, short
piles, charcoal, bones of animals, shells, fruits, seeds, etc.</p>

<p>The objects of special interest collected were fragments of
coarse pottery, made, however, on the wheel, and particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
some vessels made of <i>potstone</i>; a large stone splinter, showing
marks of usage; a bronze ring, and some iron slag.</p>

<p>In 1883 Pigorini recurs to the remains at Fontanellato (B.
408) and explains that, owing to the great progress made in the
investigations of the terramara deposits, and the additional light
thrown on the subject, he has come to the conclusion that the station
at Fontanellato was not a direct continuation of the terramara system
which prevailed in the Bronze Age, but a "palafitta barbarica," in
which he sees the practical evidence of the incursions, into the Po
valley many centuries later, of the northern hordes of barbarians
which gave the final <i>coup</i> to the Roman empire. That these people
were conversant with such structures there is ample evidence in
the analogous remains of terpen in Holland, the burgwälle and
lake-dwellings of Germany, the Tószeg and other mounds in Hungary, etc. (B. 410b.)</p>

<p>Nor does the station at Fontanellato stand as an isolated
example of these later structures. Chierici found one at
Marmirolo, in the district of Reggio.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Another is recorded by Cornalia,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
and Pigorini thinks that several other stations which
have been more or less described belong to the same class as
those in the Thrasimene district<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and that at Offida, near Piceno. (B. 343.) With these exceptions,
there are no terramara mounds of the Iron Age, and the system is
supposed to have flourished in the early Bronze Age and to have fallen
completely into desuetude before the commencement of the Iron Age.

<h2>Fourth Lecture.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">SPECIAL CHARACTER OF THE REMAINS FOUND AT LA TÈNE AND IN LAKE PALADRU:<br />
LACUSTRINE AND MARINE DWELLINGS IN THE LOWER RHINE DISTRICT AND NORTH GERMANY.</span></h2>

<h3>LA TÈNE.</h3>

<p>The celebrated lacustrine station, La Tène, is situated at the
north end of Lake Neuchâtel, just close to the present artificially
formed outlet where the land end of its mole or dyke begins.
Stretching from this point eastwards there is a gravelly elevation,
some 200 yards long by 50 wide, which, before the "Correction des Eaux
du Jura," formed a shallow part of the lake, and for this reason it
was called among the fishermen La Tène (the shallows). As early as
1858, Col. Schwab discovered this to be the site of a rich repository
of antiquities of a totally different character from those found in
any of the hitherto explored Pfahlbauten. Subsequently Professor
Desor directed his attention to the locality and made a collection of
its antiquities, among which he announced some Gallic coins
(<b><a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a></b>, No. 8) and a sword-sheath ornamented
with the forms of three fantastic animals (<b><a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a></b>, No. 9).
Further discoveries of its remarkable antiquities were made by M. Dardel-Thorens,
who for many years, while resident superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum
of Préfargier, situated close by, devoted his spare time to the
investigation of La Tène. As the relics were associated with numerous
piles there appeared to be no doubt among these antiquaries that the
station was quite analogous to the ordinary pile-dwellings of the
Stone and Bronze Ages, the only difference being that it represented
a later age.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the facilities for investigation afforded by
the lowering of the waters of the lake in 1876, which had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
effect of making La Tène dry land, nothing further was done till 1880,
when M. E. Vouga, schoolmaster at Marin, interested himself in the
matter. One reason for this neglect was the opinion that the whole
area had been already so thoroughly examined by previous explorers,
that nothing remained to be done. Before, however, describing the
discoveries of M. Vouga, it will be necessary to look more minutely at
the situation of La Tène and the nature of the substratum in which its
antiquities were found.</p>

<p>In making a section through the La Tène elevation there
is first encountered a bed of water-worn gravel and sand,
varying in thickness from three or four feet to as many yards.
This gravel had evidently been thrown up by the action of
the waves, and in it there are no antiquities found, with the
exception of occasional fragments of Roman pottery and tiles.
Beneath this superficial gravel there lies a blackish bed of
peat of considerable thickness, below which is the ancient lake
sediment. It is on the surface of this intermediate mossy
bed, and sometimes buried in it, that the objects characteristic
of La Tène are found. From these stratigraphical glimpses of
Natures workings it would appear that during prehistoric times
the whole low-lying district from Préfargier to the lake of
Bienne was a shallow bay, which became ultimately overgrown
with marsh plants and peat to the extent of forming the
"Gross Moos." Scattered throughout the deposits of this quiet
bay, and especially along the waterway to Bienne, are
frequently found antiquities belonging to all the three ages of
prehistoric times previous to the occupation of the locality by
the Romans, remains of whom are, of course, also met with.
Professor Desor, and others who have carefully examined the
locality from a geological point of view, account for the subsequent
overspreading of La Tène as the combined result of two
natural causes, viz. first, the elevation of the level of the lake
owing to sedimentary deposits or accidental obstruction in the
channels through which the surplus water found its escape;
and, second, the gradual removal, by the action of the waves,
of a protective barrier in the shape of a projecting moraine
of sand and gravel, which stretched outwards from Préfargier
in the direction of La Sauge, and sheltered La Tène for many
ages from the action of the open lake. But whatever the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
explanation may be, it is certain that a considerable change
has taken place since these sedimentary deposits of fine silt
were formed, as at the present time the amount of gravel
thrown up on the shore of La Tène is so great as to advance
the beach at the annual rate of two or three yards; and this
occurs notwithstanding that the level of the water, owing to the
operations necessitated by the "Correction des Eaux du Jura," is
even lower than it was when the neighbouring lake-dwellings of
the Stone and Bronze Ages flourished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recent Explorations.</span>&mdash;While M.
Vouga was one day making excavations near a group of piles, which
he considered to have been supports for a bridge, he came upon the
foundations of a wooden house, and in the course of clearing it out he
made the important discovery that it had been situated on the brink
of a deep channel, which had subsequently become filled up with sand
and gravel. The most natural explanation was that this channel was
an ancient river-bed which, when the house was constructed, formed
the outlet of the lake. With this idea paramount in his mind, Vouga
determined to trace out its direction and bearings. About 20 yards
farther up&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in the direction of the lake&mdash;he came
upon the remains of a second wooden house, with its foundation beams
still <i>in situ</i>, and two of its containing walls (which had evidently
fallen over) lying one over the other. Here the bank of the channel
formed a steep descent of 10 feet deep. The floor of this structure
was formed of two square-cut beams, each over 16 feet in length and
8 inches in thickness, having a series of closely-set mortised holes
for transverse beams. Its breadth was 9 feet 2 inches, and it lay
2&frac12; feet below the surface, and about 7 feet higher than the
bottom of the river. The two sides of the building were formed of
three beams corresponding in length with that of the flooring, and
about 2&frac12; feet apart, and having transverse mountings and a
trellis-work of branches. One of these had apparently fallen into
the river, as its end reached nearly to the bottom of the channel.
Pursuing his investigations still in the direction of the lake, he
came upon the remains of a third building, near which were the piles
of a second bridge. The space between the two bridges was about 100
yards, and, judging from the position of the piles, this bridge was
directed to the same point as the former&mdash;probably La Sauge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
at the opposite corner of the lake. These bridges were supported on a
succession of parallel rows of oak piles 4 to 6 inches in diameter,
and placed at intervals of 3 to 20 yards; and each row contained five
or six piles, from half a foot to 3 feet apart. About 50 yards above
the second bridge a fourth dwelling was encountered, but it appeared
to have been already pillaged of its contents. Near this our explorer
proceeded to clear a portion of the bed of the river, and lying in
the mud and gravel at a depth of 10 feet from the original surface
he found a large quantity of antiquities&mdash;swords, lances, axes,
chains, razors, various wooden implements, fragments of a large vase,
the entire wheel and other parts of a chariot, together with the bones
of men, horses, and oxen. A fifth building was subsequently discovered
between the third and fourth, so that we have here the evidence of a
row of five houses situated along the right bank of the ancient river,
and all within a distance of 200 yards.</p>

<p>On the left bank of this supposed river only one habitation,
opposite No. 1, was discovered, which M. Vouga thought had already
been pillaged. It was reported that near this spot several human
skeletons had been discovered, one of which had a rope round the neck!
Below this the channel becomes deeply buried, and the superficial
gravel attains the depth of some ten feet; but, nevertheless, Vouga
succeeded in making excavations which decided the chronological
sequence of the Roman and Gallic remains. "It was," says he, "in
the midst of these gravels that I found the layer containing Roman
remains&mdash;tiles and fragments of pottery, nails, etc.&mdash;at a
height of two and a half to three feet above the Gallic objects." (B.
428, p. 13.) These Gallic objects consisted of the well-known fibulæ
and other articles characteristic of La Tène, so that superposition
clearly indicates the Roman occupation to be posterior to that of its
original constructors.</p>

<p>M. Vouga believes that the channel, along the banks of
which he found the remains of so many houses, was the right
branch of two outlets which at that time existed, and which
united lower down to form the Thielle. The left branch was
nearer the rising ground towards Epagnier, but it is now covered
over with gravel, and has never yet been examined. Some 300
or 400 yards lower down there are some gravel pits, which are
occasionally worked for road metal, in which I saw in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
summer of 1886 a great many piles, singly and in groups,
cropping up through a black peaty deposit underneath the gravel.
I mentioned the matter to M. Vouga, and he informed me that
the few things found there indicate a Gallo-Roman period.</p>

<p>According to M. Vouga, the site of La Tène station extended from
the south bank of the outlet to the small island formed by its two
branches before they became united. The upper part of this island, now
denuded of its peaty deposits by the action of the waves, forms part
of the lake. This denuding process is still going on at the margin
of the lake all the way from La Tène to Préfargier. Large masses of
the ancient sedimentary deposits, containing piles and relics of the
lake-dwellers, become undermined and broken up by the waves, leaving
their more solid relics, such as stone hatchets, mixed with the
gravel. These are often thrown up on the beach, and in this way many
beautiful jade hatchets have been picked up from the sites of the four
lake-dwellings now almost entirely disintegrated, which existed along
the north shore from La Tène to Préfargier. It is in the gravel at the
upper end of La Tène that most of the coins have been collected.</p>

<p>The success attending Vouga's excavations induced M. Borel, on
behalf of the Museum of Neuchâtel, to make further excavations along
the banks and bed of the ancient river discovered by the former, but
without much success. Finally, in 1884, the Cantonal Government having
granted to the Historical Society the exclusive right of conducting
explorations at La Tène, this society undertook fresh excavations
under the management of Messrs. Vouga and W. Wavre. During these
researches portions of a gold torque and some gold coins were the
principal finds. These coins are valuable inasmuch as they were
found <i>in situ</i>, and not, as most of the others, among the
shifting gravel.</p>

<p>From Keller's description (B. 126) of the earlier discoveries
on La Tène it appears that Col. Schwab, on removing some
large mortised beams, found many weapons and other antiquities
all huddled together. In the light of Vouga's researches it is
probable that this spot was a dwelling similar to those I have
already described, as we are told that there were three beams
of fir wood, from 15 to 20 feet long, lying parallel to each other
and a few feet apart. These beams rested on upright piles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
contained a series of triangular holes as if for the tenons of
wooden superstructures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relics.</span>&mdash;Like the fate of most
lacustrine remains, those from La Tène have been widely scattered.
Many are deposited in the Cantonal Museums of Bienne, Neuchâtel, and
Berne. The Gross collection, being now public property, finds also a
temporary lodgment in a room in the Federal Hall in the latter town. A
few, including some of the most interesting relics, have been secured
for the Museum of Geneva. The largest of the private collections are
those of Messrs. Vouga, of Marin, and Dardel-Thorens, of St. Blaise.
With the exception of the articles in the possession of the latter
gentleman (which are, however, copiously illustrated in <i>Antiqua</i> and
the works of Vouga and Gross), I have studied more than once all these
collections. As the principal objects have already been more or less
described and illustrated in the excellent works of Keller, Desor,
Gross, and Vouga, I wish here to acknowledge that in the production
of the accompanying illustrations I have made free use of all these
publications, either to rectify my own sketches, or (and this more
especially) to give me the correct size of the objects&mdash;a point
which is rather troublesome to attain through a glass case when, as it
often happens as regards the smaller museums, authoritative officials
may not be at hand to give access to the cases.</p>

<p>Owing to the peaty nature of the matrix in which the relics
from La Tène were embedded they are in a remarkably good state of
preservation. They consist chiefly of iron implements and weapons,
presenting a striking difference not only in material but also
in form and style of manufacture from any found in the ordinary
lake-dwellings. Articles of bronze are sparingly met with, and they
are, with one or two exceptions, very dissimilar to those from the
true palafittes of the Bronze Age. In giving a short description of
these relics it will be convenient to group them under the following
heads:&mdash;(1) Arms; (2) Implements and Utensils; (3) Articles of
Ornament and Dress; (4) Horse-Trappings and Waggons; (5) Money, and
Objects of Amusement, etc.; (6) Osseous Remains.

1. <span class="smcap">Arms.</span>&mdash;<i>Swords</i> (<b><a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a></b>).&mdash;The
swords from La Tène, which now number considerably
over 100, are all made after one characteristic type. They vary in
total length from 30 to 38 inches (or even more), of which the handles
occupy 4 to 6&frac12; inches. The blade is always double-edged,
generally without a defined median ridge, and scarcely tapers in
its whole length till within a few inches of the extremity, when it
gradually forms a round blunt tip. It is devoid of ornamentation,
except in one or two instances where parallel grooves run along
the median line, or the surface becomes thickly dotted with small
impressions. Others again have small incised figures upon them
(No. 15), but these are supposed to be makers' marks&mdash;an
interpretation which seems to be corroborated from the fact that those
bearing such marks are of a superior quality. The handle is separated
from the blade by a prominent curved ridge attached to the hilt of the
blade, into the concave side of which the end of the scabbard neatly
fits. Although all the swords hitherto found at La Tène have this
dividing ridge in the form of a graceful curve such as is represented
in the illustrations, I may remark that some of the same type from
other stations are straight. What now remains of the handle is merely
the central tang, over which there was a grip of horn or wood. On this
tang were sometimes small transverse plaques for fastening the handle
(No. 8); and Vouga figures one with two small circles from a grave of
the Iron Age at Bevaix, which I here reproduce (No. 7) on account of
its striking similarity to the sword-handles from Lisnacroghera.
(See <b><a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a></b>, Nos. 1 and 2.)</p>

<p>The sheaths are formed of two plates of iron (rarely bronze),
one of which overlaps the other at the margins, where they are
riveted together. Sometimes these plates are strengthened by
one or more cross ridges, and about the lower third a raised
bead begins which runs round the tip. These attachments often
assume an ornamental character (Nos. 3, 4, and 5). The upper
surface of the sheath is also generally ornamented with a
variety of curious designs, in which spiral and recurring scroll
patterns play a conspicuous part (Nos. 3, 10, and 11). But
perhaps the most remarkable design is that of three fantastic
animals (No. 9), which, from their resemblance to the figures on
Gallic coins, first led Desor to the conclusion that the weapons
had a similar origin. Only three sheaths are known to have
been ornamented along their entire length&mdash;viz. Nos. 1, 2, and 12.
That on No. 12 was repeated three times at regular intervals.
The underside of the sheath has always a suspension clasp,
which assumes various elegant shapes (Nos. 4, 13, and 14). In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
one instance the upper sheath-plate was of bronze, and another
had both plates of iron, but the surrounding bead was of bronze.
No. 6 represents a piece of iron (being one of about a dozen
similar pieces found at La Tène), which is supposed to be the
rudimentary stage of the sword-blade.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lance and Javelin Heads</i> (<b><a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a></b>).&mdash;These
weapons are extremely varied in shape and size, as may be seen from a glance
at the illustrations. They all have sockets, and the smallness of the
bore at once distinguishes them from Roman weapons of the same class.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Sometimes the socket is short, while the blade is large and
leaf-shaped, and at other times it runs nearly the whole length of
the latter. Two nail holes, and sometimes small prominences, are seen
at the lower end of the socket, by which the wooden handle was more
firmly fastened. In a few instances (No. 12) there is no median ridge,
but generally this is a prominent feature extending the whole length
of the blade, and sometimes it assumes a triangular form, like that in
our modern bayonet (Nos. 3, 4, etc.). Another peculiarity of some of
these weapons is the cutting away of segments and semilunar portions,
either at the edges (Nos. 1, 3, and 17) or in the body of the blade
(Nos. 1 and 2). One fine weapon has an oval blade with a crenated or
wavy edge (No. 5).</p>

<p>The butt end of the wooden handle was protected by an iron knob
(Nos. 7, 10, 13, and 14), either simply conical or multilateral, above
which there was a neat ferule (No. 13).</p>

<p><i>Arrow-heads.</i>&mdash;It is only in the later excavations that a
few arrow-points have come to light. Like the spear-heads, they are all
socketed (Nos. 15 and 16).</p>

<p><i>Shields, etc.</i> (<b><a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a></b>).&mdash;Several objects
have been found at La Tène which must be considered as shield-mountings. The
umbo was of thin iron, arched in the centre, and attached to the
shield by large studs or sometimes small nails (No. 1). The handle
was made of a curved iron rod riveted to two rectangular plates of
iron attached to the shield (No. 2). Some large handsome plaques of
bronze, of a flamboyant character, are supposed to have been ornaments
on the face of the shield (Nos. 3 and 4), of which about half a dozen
altogether have been found. Besides these there are several discs and
other objects of bronze (Nos. 5, 8, 9 to 11, and 21), many of which
were probably ornaments for horse-harness, and there are some which
Dr. Gross conjectures to have been ornaments for helmets. (B. 446, p. 28.)
The curious object of thin bronze represented by No. 20 is also
supposed to be an ornament for a helmet.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Implements and
Utensils.</span>&mdash;<i>Hatchets</i> (<b><a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a></b>).&mdash;Though
comparatively rare, the hatchets are of various kinds (only about
twenty have been hitherto found). One form (Nos. 1, 2, and 7) reminds
one of the winged celt of the Bronze Age. The former, however, has
only two wings, instead of four as in the latter, and its cutting edge
is more expanded. Others are like our modern axes and adzes (Nos. 4,
5, and 6). One of this type is made of bronze, but of so diminutive a
size as to give rise to the idea that it was a toy (<b><a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a></b>, No. 31).

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
<i>Chisels and Gouges.</i>&mdash;These tools differ only from those of the
Bronze Age in being made of iron. They are in considerable numbers
(<b><a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a></b>, Nos. 33 and 34).</p>

<p><i>Hammers.</i>&mdash;Only a very few hammers are recorded; they are
small, and generally hafted by means of a central hole (No. 22). The
almost entire absence of implements from La Tène, required in the
forging of iron, is somewhat remarkable, and in striking contrast with
the number of foundry materials collected from the palafittes of "<i>le
bel âge du bronze</i>."</p>

<p><i>Saws.</i>&mdash;Also sparingly represented. Two found by Vouga had
handles, one of horn (No. 25) and the other of wood (No. 24). Another
has a solid handle of iron, and terminates at the other end in a
curious raised hook (No. 29).</p>

<p><i>File.</i>&mdash;Only one object of this class (No. 37) is recorded.</p>

<p><i>Shears.</i>&mdash;Three of these implements are here illustrated
(Nos. 15, 16, and 17), from which it will be seen that they are
precisely similar to those still used for sheep-shearing. They are
elegant in shape, and some even still retain their elasticity. The
number collected from La Tène is over a dozen.</p>

<p><i>Sickles and Scythes.</i>&mdash;The few sickles recorded resemble
those of modern times, and some of them had teeth. Scythes, more
numerous than the sickles, vary in size from 14 to 20 inches in
length, and 1&frac12; to 3 inches in breadth. They were hafted by a
crooked tang and a ring, precisely like those still in use
(Nos. 30 and 32).</p>

<p><i>Knives.</i>&mdash;As regards style and ornamentation, the knives
of the Iron Age are greatly inferior to those of the preceding age.
Their size and special characters are sufficiently shown in the
illustrations (Nos. 8 to 12). One, like the saw already noticed,
has a peculiar hook at the point (No. 23).</p>

<p><i>Razors.</i>&mdash;The so-called razors are short, thick, and heavy
blades with a rounded cutting edge, and a small prolongation as a
handle (Nos. 18, 27, and 28). One of these implements was found
adhering by its rust to a pair of shears (Nos. 17 and 18).

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
<i>Pruning Hooks.</i>&mdash;Under this category I reckon some large cutting
implements in the form of a bent knife, similar to that in present use
for cutting hedges. The one here figured from La Tène (No. 31) is very
similar to those found on some of the palafittes in Lake Constance.
(See <b><a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a></b>, No. 11.)</p>

<p><i>Pincers.</i>&mdash;Pincers are of bronze and iron, and vary
considerably both in size and form, as may be seen from the
illustrations (<b><a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a></b>, No. 11 to 14).</p>

<p><i>Pots and Dishes.</i>&mdash;Of earthenware only a few fragments
have come to light, and it is said to be of a totally different kind
from that of the true palafittes. It is black and coarse, and shows
no evidence of having been made on the wheel; but as to this there
appears to be difference of opinion. (B. 428, p. 27, and 446, p. 48.)
In addition to this kind, however, there are usually found on the
surface of the peaty bed and in the superimposed gravel beds fragments
of tiles, pottery, etc., the Roman origin of which cannot be mistaken;
but such industrial remains, according to the explorers, are more
superficial, and, consequently, posterior to the Gallic remains.
(B. 428, p. 27.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, La Tène has furnished several large pots of
beaten bronze, with rims and ring-handles of iron (<b><a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a></b>,
No. 19), some bronze cups (No. 18), a large iron ladle (No. 20), and one
or two chains with large hooks, probably pot-hangers (No. 1). The cup
here represented was found on the shore in the vicinity of La Tène,
but it is supposed to have come from this station.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><i>Fishing Materials</i> (<b><a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a></b>).&mdash;Among
this class of objects are some large spears with two or three prongs (No. 14),
fishing-hooks of bronze and iron (Nos. 39 and 40), and some implements
like the iron tips of boating gaffs (Nos. 13 and 26).</p>

<p><i>Diverse.</i>&mdash;Hammer-stones, polishers, and corn-grinders
are like those used in the preceding ages.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Objects of Ornament and
Dress.</span>&mdash;As regards the objects coming under this category,
if we exclude the fibulæ and torques, which we now know to have been
worn by men as well as women, it is noteworthy that those peculiar to
female adornment are extremely rare, if not entirely awanting&mdash;a
fact which strongly supports the theory that this station was a military fort.

No. 32 = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, and the rest = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Fibulæ</i> (<b><a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a></b>).&mdash;The number
of fibulæ from La Tène now amounts to several hundreds. They are all made
on one principle, viz. that of our modern safety-pins. This principle is
simply an evolutionary stage of the function of the straight pin,
by which the point is bent round so as to meet the top after having
subjected the stem to several twists so as to give it elasticity. In
the part corresponding to the top of the pin there is a catch for
the point when fastened. The ornamentation on the upper part and the
number of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
spiral twists on the stem are so varied that each fibula has a
distinct individuality of its own, and no two specimens exactly alike
have ever yet been found. Their average size is from two to six inches
in length, but sometimes they exceed this, as in one here figured (No.
1), which is 10&frac12; inches in length. They are almost exclusively
made of iron (Nos. 1 to 6), the exceptions being one or two of bronze
(Nos. 18 and 26), and a small circular-shaped brooch of gold (B.
428, p. 28), which are somewhat analogous to those of the Hallstadt period.</p>

<p><i>Pins, Needles, etc.</i>&mdash;The ornamental pins are few in number,
and generally made of bronze. Of four here figured (Nos. 8, 9, 10, and
36) one has a double stem, and is so similar to some half-dozen found
in the Pfahlbauten of the Bronze Age that it is more likely to be a
stray object from the latter than a relic of La Tène. Nor is this at
all improbable, as we have already seen that there were several of
these stations quite in the vicinity of La Tène, the relic-beds of
which have become almost entirely disintegrated by the waves.</p>

<p>A remarkable object, found by Vouga, consists of an ornamental
bronze tube, closed at one end, and having six movable rings
symmetrically arranged (No. 19). There can be no doubt this was a
needle-holder, as it contained a well-formed needle of iron (No.
20). Another curious object, having an eye like that of a needle,
terminating in an elongated bulb instead of a sharp point, is
represented by No. 15.</p>

<p><i>Buckles, Rings, etc.</i>&mdash;A large assortment of iron clasps
(Nos. 27 and 30), buckles (Nos. 28 and 32), rings (No. 33), etc., is
to be found in all the collections from La Tène. There are also to be
met with a few beads and buttons of bronze (No. 23), and some glass
beads of a pretty blue colour, or variegated with blue, yellow, and
white (Nos. 22, 24, and 25). One has part of a bronze twisted wire
passing through it (No. 21).</p>

<p><i>Bracelets.</i>&mdash;In striking contrast to the fibulæ, bracelets
are very rare. Dr. Gross figures one of bronze wire; another of an
iron rod, with the inside flattened; and a third of iron plate,
riveted, forming a hollow tube, reminding one of the ornamental hollow
rings of the Bronze Age. (B. 446, Pl x. 17, 18, and 27.) Of the two
here figured (Nos. 34 and 35), one is a spiral rod, and the other a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
flat band, both of iron. Fragments of glass bracelets, in the form of
a flat band, having the outside ornamented with wavy corrugations,
have also been found. (B. 126, p. 294.)</p>

<p><i>Neck-Rings.</i>&mdash;Several portions of massive neck rings,
precisely similar to those represented on ancient statuary as peculiar
to distinguished Gallic warriors, as, for example, that on the neck of
the "Dying Gladiator" in Rome, have been found at La Tène. They appear
to have been made of two symmetrical portions, which, when worn, were
united at the back of the neck, and then formed a large penannular
ring, with an expanded bulb at each end (Nos. 16 and 17). They were
sometimes plain rings, but generally they were more or less worked
into some artistic pattern. That represented on the dying gladiator is
distinctly seen to be twisted spirally immediately above the terminal
bulbs. Of the two here represented, one (No. 16) is of gold, and
weighs 72·90 grammes, and the other of bronze (No. 17).</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Horse-Trappings, Waggons,
etc.</span>&mdash;Among the objects under this class we have not only
bridle-bits (<b><a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a></b>, Nos. 14 to 18), spurs
(No. 6), various discs and other objects of bronze, supposed to have been
ornaments on horse-harness (Nos. 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 21), but the actual
remains of waggons, as wheels (No. 12), part of the wooden pole, linch-pins
(No. 19), and other attachments. The wheel here figured shows a nave
with 10 spokes and fellies, which are bound together by an iron
hoop, precisely similar to the wheels now in use. "La roue entière,"
writes its discoverer, "a un mètre de diamètre; trouvée en compagnie
d'épées gauloises, elle avait sur le moyeu un umbo de bouclier. Le
cercle de fer qui l'entoure, d'environ un centimètre d'épaisseur, a 5
centimètres de largeur, le moyeu a 60 centimètres de longueur, il est
formé de deux pièces, reliées de chaque côté par un ou deux petits
cercles. Les rais sont en chêne au nombre de dix et la jante est, ou
plutôt était, d'une seule pièce courbée et paraît de frêne; elle avait
été raccommodée et la pièce est assujettie au moyen d'un clou et d'une
embrasse de fer.</p>

<p>"Elle était encore entière, mais, en la transportant, quelques
rais tombèrent et comme je ne pus pas la mettre immédiatement et
entièrement dans l'eau, la jante se retira en peu de jours, laissant
un espace entre le bois et le fer, de sorte que, quand je voulus mettre
la roue entière dans son bassin de zinc, elle se sépara en plusieurs morceaux.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dans la même couche, mais dans la partie inférieure,
puisqu'elle allait en pente, on trouvait des parties d'autres
roues, des rais, moyeux calcinés, des manches de haches droits
ou coudés pour celts, des parties de bois de lances, des poches
en bois avec manches des fragments de grandes écuelles en
bois, etc., de grandes et fortes poutres avec mortaises."
(B. 428, p. 22.)</p>

<p>The fragments of this interesting relic are now carefully preserved
in liquid in a large trough in the Museum at Neuchâtel.</p>

<p>The number of bridle-bits (excluding objects represented by Nos. 15
and 16, which are also supposed to have been used for this purpose)
amounts to about a dozen. They are all made of well-beaten iron, with
the exception of one (No. 17) which has a superficial layer of bronze
over the iron, and have large side-rings, and a central mouthpiece
divided into two symmetrical halves.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Money, Objects of Amusement,
etc.</span>&mdash;<i>Coins.</i>&mdash;But perhaps the most interesting
feature of La Tène is the discovery of coins among its strange
assortment of relics. Some of these are Roman, but others are
undoubtedly of Gallic origin, being identical with those otherwise
known to have been current among the various tribes in Gaul, prior to
any intervention in their affairs by the Romans. In most cases they
were picked up on the surface or amongst constantly shifting gravel,
and of course no conclusive inferences could be drawn from them. This
uncertainty is now, however, removed by the discovery of two gold
pieces at a depth of 10 feet below the present surface, and associated
with the usual characteristic objects of La Tène. "En creusant à la
drague," says Vouga, "les pêcheurs de M. Schwab ont découvert une
monnaie d'or et plusieurs monnaies d'argent et de potin ou de bronze.
Plus tard, M. Alexis Dardel et d'autres personnes en ont aussi trouvé
en assez grand nombre, surtout sur la tourbe et sur les bords du lac
où les vagues les entraînaient, et une quantité de monnaies romaines
avec des monnaies de Marseille, de Nîmes, de Lyon, de Vienne. Le
plus grand nombre a dû se trouver sur l'île, entre les deux bras de
la Thielle; mais de là, à mesure que le terrain était enlevé, ces
monnaies étaient balayées et entraînées au bord avec les graviers.

<p>"Comme elles se trouvent toutes pêle-mêle, on ne peut en tirer
des conclusions bien sûres. Il n'en est pas de même de deux
monnaies en or trouvées à trois mètres de profondeur avec les
objets mêmes de la Tène, en février, 1884; ce sont, d'après les
descriptions qu'en a faites M. le Dr. Trachsel, de Lausanne, qui
les croit Carnutes, du pays Chartrain. Une monnaie gauloise, en
or pâle, concave, du poids de 7.783 grammes (<b><a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a></b>, No. 2):
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
A. Tête à bandeau royal; R. Aurige conduisant un char attelé
de deux chevaux; à l'exergue, inscription étrusque ou grecque,
indistincte." (B. 428, p. 29.) The other coin is very like the
above in every respect, except that it is smaller, being only
about one quarter of its weight.</p>

<p>The gold coins are rare, only seven in all, according to Vouga,
being recorded. One, in the Museum of Bienne, is described by Keller
(B. 126, p. 302, and Pl. xv. 34) as a bad imitation of the Macedonian
coins of Philip. Another (described in the <i>Anzeiger</i> for 1883, p.
401) is similar to <b><a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a></b>, No. 2. A fifth is a fragment, and
the remaining two consist of small elongated rolls of gold (No. 10).<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Besides the gold coins from La Tène, there are about 100 of silver,
and about the same number of bronze or potin (a mixture of copper,
tin, and lead), representing a great variety of coinages, both native
and foreign (Nos. 3 to 9, and 11).</p>

<p>Dr. Gross, having submitted some specimens of these coins, intended
as illustrations for his work on La Tène, to M. A. de Barthelémy,
publishes the following as the opinion of this eminent numismatist as
to their date:&mdash;</p>

<p>"En résumé les monnaies dessinées sur la planche XI, à l'exception
des Nos. 23 et 24 [gold coins] qui, à cause de leur métal, ont en un
cours prolongé, sont de la seconde moitié du premier siècle avant
l'ère chrétienne, principalement de la fin." (B. 446, p. 47.)</p>

<p><i>Amusements.</i>&mdash;Among objects of this nature are several dice,
some of bronze and others of bone (Nos. 12 to 14). Also, about a dozen
small stones of the size of ordinary marbles, and perfectly round,
except on one side, where there is a segment, as it were, cut off, are
supposed to have been used for some kind of game.</p>

<p><i>Diverse.</i>&mdash;In concluding this summary of the relics from
La Tène, I have merely to mention as unclassified objects a four-footed
figurine and a small wheel, both of bronze, and in the collection
of Mr. Dardel (Nos. 16 and 17). Dr. Gross describes a bronze object
resembling a tobacco-pipe (No. 21) which, he believes, was found on
this station.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Osseous Remains.</span>&mdash;To these relics is
further to be added a large quantity of the osseous remains of men and domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
animals. Of the circumstances in which the earlier finds of this
description were made we have not very definite information. Keller,
writing in 1866 (B. 126, p. 295), speaks of a basketful of human bones
representing some eight individuals; and Desor about the same time
found a human skull, which he figures in his work on the palafittes.
(B. 95.) M. Vouga, however, gives precise and most interesting
information regarding the conditions in which he encountered the
osseous remains of human beings, as well as those of the horse, ox,
pig, and dog.</p>

<p>We have already seen how M. Vouga came upon the <i>débris</i> of a
series of wooden houses constructed on the banks of an ancient river.
Referring to these establishments he thus writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Devant le premier établissement je trouvai un crâne entier de
femme. Devant le second, je trouvai pareillement les ossements de
trois ou quatre personnes et trois crânes, dont un portait les
traces de coups d'épée sur le sommet; un second était remarquable
par sa déformité et l'extension de la partie postérieure. Devant
le quatrième, deux mâchoires inférieures et les ossements dune
trentaine de personnes, avec un très grand nombre d'os de chevaux,
de b&oelig;ufs, et de porcs. Devant le troisième, un crâne de chien
grand et entier. Devant le cinquième, trois squelettes entiers dont
un portait une corde au cou(?).</p>

<p>"Outres ces crânes et ces ossements dont je puis indiquer la
provenance, il a été trouvé un grand nombre d'autres squelettes,
d'ossements divers, de crânes de chevaux appartenant à une petite race.</p>

<p>"Je ne pourrais pas garantir l'âge de tous les squelettes, puisque,
comme je l'ai dit en commençant, deux doivent être bourguignons,
ayant retrouvé l'emplacement de la tombe avec un poignard de cette
époque, et que six autres se sont trouvés à mi-hauteur, non loin d'un
chénau en bois, et que la couche romaine paraissait s'incliner vers ce
côté-là," (B. 428, p. 31.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concluding Remarks on La Tène.</span>&mdash;In
face of the above facts, the opinion of the earlier investigators that
La Tène was an ordinary palafitte of the Iron Age, analogous to the
lake-villages of the preceding ages, can no longer be entertained. Its
geographical position, commanding the great highway between Constance
and Geneva, and the vast preponderance of warlike weapons among its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
relics, clearly point to its having been a military station or
outlook. Nor does it require much penetration to learn from its
present ruins something of its final fate. The quantity of human
bones representing some 30 or 40 individuals, some with gashes on the
tops of their skulls; the number of abandoned swords, still in their
scabbards; the incongruous medley of relics found by Vouga at the
bottom of the ancient river-bed&mdash;all indicate that its capture by
an enemy was sudden and the struggle fierce. The discovery of Roman
remains, such as coins, tiles, pottery, bricks (one with the mark of
the 21st legion, "Rapax"),<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
on and around La Tène, leave little doubt that its conquerors were the Romans.</p>

<h3>LAKE PALADRU.</h3>

<p>From time immemorial a legend prevailed among the inhabitants
around Lake Paladru that a city had been buried in its waters&mdash;a
catastrophe brought about by the maledictions of the monks of the
neighbouring Carthusian establishment of Sylve Bénite. On the 24th
September, 1864, M. Vallier, of Grenoble, and some friends arranged
a boating excursion for the purpose of examining the lake as to the
reported existence of piles in it, with the view of accounting for the
currency of the above legend, and found no less than six different
sites where piles were to be seen projecting more or less from the
mud. These were supposed to be the remains of lacustrine villages of
which the following particulars were ascertained:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Station des Grands
Roseaux.</span>&mdash;This station was situated near the head of the
lake, and about two hundred yards from shore; depth of water from one
to two feet; piles sometimes three feet apart, and sometimes much
less; over 150 were counted.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Stat. de l'Ile de Loyasse.</span>&mdash;Two
hundred and fifty yards from the former, and about 100 yards from
shore. Only about twenty piles were counted.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Stat. de la Genevrière.</span>&mdash;About
600 yards farther on and 70 yards from shore. About twenty piles counted.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Stat. de la Neyre.</span>&mdash;About 200
yards from the preceding, and close to the shore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Stat. du Plâtre.</span>&mdash;About thirty
piles counted in water from 10 to 13 feet deep.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Stat. du Puits des
Carpes.</span>&mdash;Fifty or sixty piles observed close to each other
and about 20 yards from the shore.</p>

<p>These indications of pile-dwellings, though strengthened by further
observations by M. Vallier in the following year, really contributed
little to the elucidation of the problem as to the period to which
they belonged; so that the work of M. Vallier, "La Légende de la Ville
d'Ars sur les Bords du Lac de Paladru," leaves the question much in
the same position as it was left by Professor Fournet, who had already suggested, in 1860,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
that the legend of the buried city had its origin in the former
existence of lake-dwellings. It remained to M. Ernest Chantre, of
Lyons, to make the first practical investigations to clear up the
mystery. To this line of research he was led by the encouragement and
knowledge he had received at the first meeting of the International
Congress of Prehistoric Archæology, held at Neuchâtel, in 1866,
when he had an opportunity of being initiated by Professor Desor
and others in lacustrine research. His first efforts, an account of
which was published in the <i>Matériaux</i> for 1867, showed that two
of the stations mentioned by M. Vallier belonged to the Iron Age.
Learning then that engineering works were in progress for regulating
the outflow of the waters of this lake, which would have the effect
of lowering its level, M. Chantre deferred his proposed excavations
till these more favourable conditions should be accomplished. His
subsequent investigations, conducted in the autumn of 1870, were
confined to the first-named station (Grands Roseaux), which, from his
former experience, gave greater promise of archæological results.
From it he had already picked up some bones of the ox, pig, stag,
etc., the kernels of a species of small cherry and of two kinds of
plums, fragments of pottery of a different kind from any found in the
Swiss lake-dwellings, an iron knife, and a wooden comb. Owing to the
lowering of the lake the station was now (1870) a foot above water,
and it could be easily examined by the spade on <i>terra firma</i>. In the
excavations which ensued the following strata were met with:&mdash;(1)
Eight inches of peaty mud and roots of water plants; (2) About eighteen inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
of peat containing bits of worked wood and bones; (3) Ten inches of
peat containing bones, fragments of pottery, and a great variety of
antiquities; (4) Underneath this peat was the whitish lake sediment
known as shell-marl.</p>

<p>The area occupied by the piles and wooden beams was about 1,600
square yards in extent, and of a somewhat circular shape. The tops of
the piles were water-worn, and projected above the mud from one foot
to one foot and a half. They were made of the stems of trees from 10
to 16 feet long, and 7&frac12; to 15 inches in diameter, some being
squared and pointed with the hatchet, and most of them penetrated
to the shell-marl. Their distance from each other varied very much.
Many were observed to be in groups of four, rectangularly placed,
with cross timbers stretching between them, thus forming a series
of square or rectangular chambers. The cross-beams overlapped each
other, and each had a cutaway cavity at the point of crossing, which
kept it in position, precisely on the principle on which the Swiss
chalets are constructed at the present day. The walls of the submerged
compartments contained some four or five of these transverses, and
the space enclosed varied from 7 to 30 feet long. In the larger
spaces the uprights were not restricted to the corners, but occupied
intermediate positions inside the enclosed area. Numerous tenons,
mortises, pegs, and other portions of worked timbers, proved that
these structures were erected by the hatchet and chisel alone, as none
showed any evidence of the use of the saw; nor were there any iron nails found.</p>

<p>The woodwork was so abundant, that the removal of it became a regular
employment; and for its discovery the mud was probed with iron rods.</p>

<p>In two places a double row of piles stretched to the shore, one 230
feet and the other 130 feet long, which, there can be little doubt,
were the remains of gangways.</p>

<p>The industrial relics (<b><a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a></b>) consisted largely
of iron objects, among which were several knives (No. 3), an axe (No. 11), an
· awl, a gimlet, part of a pair of shears (No. 2), a chisel, part of a
lock (No. 8), chains (No. 7), several keys (No. 9), horseshoes (Nos. 5 and 6),
a curry-comb (No. 10), a spur (No. 12), a lance (No. 4), and portions of a javelin.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Of other materials there were two bone-counters (Nos. 14 and 15), a
sharpening stone, the half of a leaden bracelet (No. 1), and a number
of wooden objects, viz. two combs (No. 21), spoons (No. 19), pestles
(No. 17), a bobbin (No. 20), and some perforated bits, like floats for
nets (Nos. 13 and 16).</p>

<p>Pottery is of a greyish-black colour, well baked, and fashioned on
the wheel, with an ornamentation of a very unusual character (Nos. 18,
22, 23, and 24). The only entire vessel was flask-shaped, having a
hole in the middle of one of its sides (No. 24). Some pieces of cloth
like Roman tissues, and a portion of a Roman vase, were also found.</p>

<p>The animals identified from the bones were the ox, sheep, goat,
horse (a small race), pig, dog, and a large-sized otter. Among the
remains of fruits were two species of cherry, two species of plums,
peaches, walnuts, hazel-nuts, acorns, etc.</p>

<p>Oak was the only wood used in the construction of the submerged
foundations, with the exception of one trunk of a chestnut tree; but
ash, cornel-cherry, and box had been used for making utensils. (B.
193.)</p>

<p>In 1885, owing to the lowness of the water in the lake, further
discoveries were made on this station (Grands Roseaux). Immediately
in front of the lacustrine village, on its lake side, a triple row
of piles was detected, which appeared to have acted as a breakwater;
and on its site, along with some great oak-beams, were found various
relics of a similar character to those already described. Among these
were the following iron objects of the Carlovingian period&mdash;viz.
17 knives, 2 keys, a hook, a pair of shears, a stirrup, 2 spurs,
a portion of the umbo of a shield, and some horseshoes of a small
size. The other objects recorded were two portions of wooden spoons,
fragments of a comb made of yew, and a piece of goatskin.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<h3>RHINE DISTRICT.</h3>

<p>In the two lacustrine stations just described we had to deal
with remains essentially different from any that have hitherto
come under our notice. In La Tène both stone and bronze
objects are quite the exception, while those of iron are not only
in great abundance, but, from their variety and style of art,
clearly show that the working and forging of this metal had
reached a great state of perfection. In short, we have inherent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
evidence that the civilisation of the Bronze Age was now superseded by
one of a totally different character, and yet it would seem that this
complete change had been accomplished independent of, and prior to,
the advent of the Romans. On the other hand, the class of antiquities
found in Lake Paladru brings us down to Carlovingian times, probably
as late as the ninth or tenth century. In pursuing our investigations
northwards we find records of many lake-dwellings which, like
these, are the products of later ages than those in which the Swiss
Pfahlbauten flourished. But, at the same time, there is satisfactory
evidence as regards others in the same localities that they belonged
to the Prehistoric Ages. Professor Virchow (B. 165) considers that,
with one or two exceptions, all the lake-dwellings of North Germany
were founded during the Iron Age, and, like our Scottish and Irish
crannogs, continued down to the Middle Ages. As regards many, however,
no conclusive inferences can be drawn, as they are imperfectly or
entirely unexplored.</p>

<h3>THE PALATINATE.</h3>

<p>Mr. C. Mehlis (B. 400) states that in the low-lying land
near Billigheim, on the left bank of the Rhine, evidences of a
pile-dwelling have for many years been observed. In one place piles
were found in their original position. They consisted of square-cut
oak beams, about six feet long, and placed in the form of a rectangle.
Near them were collected in great numbers tiles of a dark-red colour,
fragments of pottery peculiar to the period from the tenth to the
thirteenth century, and bones of the deer. In addition to these
relics, which point to the early Middle Ages, there were others at
a greater depth which no less conclusively point to a much earlier
period. These are described as implements of stone and flint, such
as knives, axes, spear-heads, etc.</p>

<p>Other indications were noticed in the turf-beds at Landstuhl
and Durkheim; and below Mayence, Lindenschmit has shown that a
pile-dwelling existed in Roman times. Other stations are said to be
at Würzburg, Wiesentheid, and Niedissigheim, in which the bones of
various oxen and pigs were found associated with piles. (400a, p. 254.)</p>

<h3>DEÛLE-À-HOUPLIN.</h3>

<p>In 1876 M. Rigaux announced the existence of a pile-dwelling
in the marsh of Deûle-à-Houplin, in the Département du Nord,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
in which were found not only broken bones, flint objects chipped
and polished, and pottery, but also some metal objects.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<h3>MAESTRICHT (HOLLAND).</h3>

<p>In the valley of the Meuse, near Maestricht, Mr. Ubaghs (B. 413)
describes a sort of artificial island composed of trunks of trees
brushwood, leaves, etc., which came to light in 1883 in the course of
railway excavations. This curious structure lies close to the canal
from Maestricht to Bois-le-Duc; and it appears that when this canal,
many years ago, was being constructed, it is recorded that the workmen
had come upon much wood and bones, which were thrown away as of no
importance. The portion now exposed by the railway excavations was
about 16 feet below the surface and extended parallel to the canal for
about 50 yards, with a breadth of 11 yards, and Mr. Ubaghs estimates
that 4 or 5 yards more were destroyed by the canal operations. The
trunks were from 6 to 13 feet long and, in some instances, 1 foot in
diameter. The larger ones were underneath and reposed on a bed of
gravel, in which they were partially embedded. Above the beams were
decayed branches and leaves, forming a bed of vegetable <i>débris</i>
some eight or nine inches in thickness, but no upright piles were
anywhere observed. Mr. Ubaghs considers this was in former times an
island constructed partly, at least, artificially, like the Irish
crannogs or the Pfahlbauten at Schussenried, and that it served as a
dwelling-place for hunters, who left the remains of feasts and broken
weapons behind them.</p>

<p>Among the objects of archæological value collected were the
following:&mdash;Portion of a human skull, and various bones of the
horse, urus, ox, stag, goat, dog, pig, beaver, and the humerus of a
bird. The industrial relics consisted of various kinds of implements
and weapons of bone and staghorn, as harpoons, perforated clubs,
daggers, etc., of which a few are here represented (<b><a href="#Fig_94">Fig. 94</a></b>).
As these illustrations are merely copied from Ubaghs' work, and are
not drawn to scale, I give the respective lengths of the objects, viz.
(1) 15&frac12;, (2) 10, (3) 6&frac12;, (4) 13&frac12;, (5) 4&frac34;,
(6) 3, and (7) 3&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>No complete skeleton of any animal was found, because, as Mr.
Ubaghs remarks, these hunters only carried certain portions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the dead animals to their abodes. It was also observed that the
spongy portions of the bones had been gnawed away, probably by dogs.</p>

<p>To the portion of the human skull (<i>dolichocephalic</i>) there is now
more than ordinary interest attached, as it was near the same spot
that Professor Crahay discovered the celebrated human jaw known as the
"Smeermaas mâchoire," and subsequently described by Sir Charles Lyell
in his "Antiquity of Man" as coeval with a mammoth tusk found in the
vicinity. The present skull was found 11 to 13 feet below the surface,
lying upon the gravel bed on which the wooden structures reposed. From
a careful comparison of it with the "Crahay jaw," now in the cabinet
of anatomy in the University of Leyden, Mr. Ubaghs found that the
two relics were identical as to patina, consistency of bone, and the
composition of the material in which they were embedded (traces of
which still adhered to them), and he comes to the prosaic conclusion
that the two belonged to the Maestricht crannog: "Cette mâchoire,
ainsi que les autres ossements de la même provenance, ont appartenu à
notre station lacustre près de Maestricht."</p>

<p>M. Kerkhoffs<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
attacks Sir Charles Lyell for some palpable mistakes he has made
regarding the relative positions of the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> Crahay jaw and the
mammoth tusk. According to Sir Charles, the tusk was found "six yards
removed from the human jaw, in horizontal distance."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
M. Kerkhoffs gives the following quotation from Crahay's original
notice of the discovery:&mdash;"Dans une pointe que forme le
plateau de Kaberg, en s'avançant dans la plaine, près de Smeermaas,
on a rencontré dans la terre argileuse à 6m50 au-dessous du sol,
la mâchoire inférieure d'un homme garnie de ses dents, sans être
accompagnée d'aucun autre reste; elle ne semblait pas avoir roulé;
les ouvriers assurent que la terre n'y avait pas été remuée. L'os
est très fragile, mais n'a pas été dans cet état de mollesse des
ossements d'éléphants; aussi n'est-ce pas la même couche de terre;
car au-dessous de cette mâchoire s'étendait une couche irregulière
de gravier et de cailloux de 2 à 3 mètres d'épaisseur, au-dessous de
laquelle était placée une nouvelle couche argileuse dans laquelle on a
trouvé des restes d'éléphants à 14 mètres au-dessous du sol."</p>

<p>From these remarks it would appear that Sir Charles Lyell's
account of the position of the <i>mâchoire</i> is neither a fact nor
in accordance with Professor Crahay's description of the conditions
in which it was found, as the tusk is here described as having
been over 24 feet deeper.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<h3>NORTH GERMANY.&mdash;(<span class="smcap">a</span>) MECKLENBURG.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lattmoor.</span>&mdash;The discovery of
lake-dwellings in North Germany dates back to the summer of 1863, when
Dr. Lisch, Curator of the Antiquarian Museum at Schwerin, accompanied
one Sergeant Büsch to inspect a peat bog at a place called Gägelow,
in the vicinity of Wismar, where the latter reported that some stone
implements had been found. Dr. Lisch recognised in this place the
site of a lake-dwelling and looked upon the discovery as one of great
importance. Soon afterwards Büsch, who was a member of the Antiquarian
Society of Schwerin, and took an active part in collecting objects for
the museum, ascertained that similar remains were often met with in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the peat bog known as the Lattmoor, situated about a mile to the
north of the town of Wismar. On the 4th July, 1864, Büsch so greatly
astonished the members of the society with the number and variety
of objects he placed before them that Dr. Lisch again accompanied
him to this new field of discovery, and again came to the conclusion
that it was the site of a true Pfahlbau. Sergeant Büsch, to whom
the credit of these discoveries was undoubtedly due, became greatly
elated over his successes, and continued to supply Dr. Lisch with the
most extraordinary objects from this lake-dwelling, all of which were
accepted without exciting the slightest suspicion that any of them
had been falsified. In 1865 Dr. Lisch published an illustrated report
of the Wismar lake-dwellings (B. 100), and the subject attracted much
attention in archæological circles on account of their analogy to
those in Switzerland. Shortly after the appearance of Lisch's work Dr.
Lindenschmit, of Mayence, announced that certain objects included in
a small collection which Büsch had sent to him were falsifications,
and especially pointed out a bone comb and some other bone objects
which undoubtedly came under this category. The doubts thus cast on
the relics from the Wismar lake-dwelling became intensified when soon
afterwards Büsch got into trouble in regard to some money matters,
which ended in his being convicted and punished for forgery. Not only
was there now doubt cast upon the genuineness of the entire relics,
so much prized at the Schwerin Museum, but the very existence of the
lake-dwelling was called in question. After this untoward event Dr.
Lisch became more cautious and carefully inspected all the relics that
had already come to the museum, the result of which was that Büsch
had not only fabricated a considerable number, but also included real
objects of antiquity found elsewhere as coming from the lake-dwelling.
All the doubtful specimens were then carefully eliminated from the
collection, and further investigations were undertaken by competent
and trustworthy men, notably Messrs. Fromm and Mann of Wismar. The
result of this inquiry was such as to leave no doubt whatever as
to the genuineness of the Wismar lake-dwelling, as the same class
of objects continued to be found after the disappearance of the
unfortunate Büsch altogether from the scene. A couple of years later
Dr. Lisch published a second report of the Wismar Pfahlbauten (B.
142), in which he notes those articles he considered to have been
forgeries, chiefly objects of bone and horn, in his previous report,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and incorporates the further discoveries. Since 1867 little
peat-cutting has been carried on in this part of the moor, and the
antiquities have correspondingly decreased. A final report of this
lake-dwelling was, however, given in 1873, by Dr. Lisch, which in
every respect confirms its previous character. (B. 242.) Professor
Virchow, who also visited the locality and, with his usual critical
acumen, investigated the whole matter, came to the conclusion
that, notwithstanding Büsch's incomprehensible mystifications, the
lake-dwelling at Wismar was undoubtedly trustworthy. (B. 165.)</p>

<p>I visited the Museum of Schwerin during the summer of 1888 for
the express purpose of seeing these remains, and after a careful
inspection of them I could not differ from the conclusions arrived at
by Lisch and Virchow. Moreover, I had the assurance of Miss Buchheim,
custodian of the antiquarian department, that there could be no doubt
at all that the entire collection from Wismar now in the museum was as
genuine as anything of the kind in Europe.</p>

<p>The lake-dwelling remains occupy a separate compartment in one of
the wall-cases. Among those from Wismar are 32 flint hatchets and
chisels more or less perfect (<b><a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a></b>, No. 6),
three perforated stone axe-heads (Nos. 16 and 17), eight semilunar flint saws
(Nos. 11 and 12), one or two arrow-points (No. 20), a flint dagger with
handle (No. 10), some flint flakes and a number of polishers
(No. 18). Of horn and bone there are many worked portions, among which
are three perforated implements (No. 14), one perforated bead of amber,
portions of piles and worked wood, and a large heap of bones. But, of
course, all the objects have not come to this museum, as there are
some described in Dr. Lisch's reports which have evidently found a
resting-place in some other collections. Among the relics are not only
large hollow polishing-stones and round rubbers, but also fragments
of true querns or handmills, the presence of which appeared to have
astonished Dr. Lisch, as he considered the latter to be of much later
date than any of the other associated objects.</p>

<p>Of bronze only one socketed celt with side loop and portion of an
arm band are mentioned.</p>

<p>The pottery was of a peculiar character, much broken and difficult
to make out. One portion, which is here represented (No. 9), shows
groups of lines running up and down the bulge of the vessel. A few
clay spindle-whorls were also found.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
Among the osseous remains Professor Rütimeyer identified the following
animals:&mdash;ox (<i>Bos taurus and primigenius</i>), sheep, goat, pig
(<i>Sus scrofa ferus</i> and <i>domesticus</i>), stag, roe, horse, dog, beaver,
rat, wild duck, seal, tortoise, and pike. A few human bones were also collected.</p>

<p>The site of this lake-dwelling is in the low ground known as
the Lattmoor, a short distance to the north of the town of Wismar.
Judging from the nature of the locality and its surroundings, all
authorities are agreed that in prehistoric times it was the bed of
an irregularly shaped lake, but of no great depth. The piles were
found by the peat-cutters in a somewhat contracted portion some 260
yards to the south of the Muggenburg tile works. On excavating into
the accumulated deposits of this basin the following layers were
encountered:&mdash;(1) ordinary turf, about 5 feet; (2) a layer of
alluvial mould, about 1 foot thick; (3) black muddy stuff, containing
the remains of water plants for a depth of 10 feet. It was in the
latter that rotten piles were detected, which penetrated its whole
depth to the underlying glacial clay. These piles were about 10 feet
long and 6 or 7 inches thick; and they were placed about 2 feet apart,
with their present tops at least 6 feet below the surface of the bog.
From the arrangement of the woodwork Dr. Lisch formed the opinion that
the huts erected over them were both round and square, and he thought
he recognised three of the former and two of the latter. The round
huts had a diameter of 14 to 18 feet, and were placed at intervals of
6 to 8 feet. Horizontal beams were found both on the supposed sites of
these huts and in the intervals. Leading from one of the huts to the
shore there was a line of seven or eight large granite stones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gägelow.</span>&mdash;The site of the Gägelow
lake-dwelling, the first discovered in North Germany, is a small
hollow near the seashore a few miles to the west of Wismar. This
hollow contained a rich deposit of mould, which Herr Seidenschnur, the
proprietor, was in the habit of utilising as manure for his fields.
It appears that as early as 1861 some horn objects were found in
the stuff taken out of this place, which, on being presented to the
Museum at Schwerin, then led Dr. Lisch to make the suggestion of a
lake-dwelling&mdash;a suggestion which was afterwards confirmed by his
visit to the place in May, 1863.</p>

<p>By the removal of the mould from year to year, this hollow
had been partially converted into its pristine aqueous condition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
which, however, could hardly be dignified by the name of a lake,
being nothing more than a pond, some 40 yards long by 30 broad. Here
a semicircular area containing oak piles was detected, which measured
about 22 feet in diameter. The piles were 7 to 10 feet long, and 7
to 8 inches thick, and interspersed among them were some horizontal
beams. Associated with this wooden structure were found various kinds
of antiquities&mdash;viz. four polished or chipped axes of flint
(<b><a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a></b>, Nos. 2 and 3), two perforated axe-hammer
heads of diorite (No. 4), a portion of a third (No. 7), and some flint daggers
(No. 1) and flakes. A four-cornered mortar of grey basalt, 3&frac12;
inches high by 2&frac12; broad (No. 8); the corners of this vessel are
rounded, and its surface neatly polished. A hand-millstone or quern,
1 foot in diameter and 2&frac12; inches thick, made of porous basalt:
this quern had a hole in the centre, with two swallow-tail notches
on each side for fixing the handle, and its under surface was worked
into a series of narrow grooves, precisely similar to those of Roman
and post-Roman times. There were also some spindle-whorls (No. 19),
a portion of a clay weight, and fragments of dishes of black and red
pottery, some of which had handles. The bones were all of the ordinary
domestic animals.</p>

<p><i>Marine Pile-dwellings.</i>&mdash;The spirit of antiquarian research
aroused in the neighbourhood by these discoveries, led to the
recognition of the remains of marine pile-dwellings (Meerpfahlbauten)
in the bay of Wismar. Attention was first directed to this subject by
Mr. Mann, who pointed out that for several years past flint hatchets,
daggers, and knives, as well as various objects of horn and bone, and
even bronze implements, were frequently turned up by the dredging
machines used in the harbour. The matter, however, excited no interest
among the workmen, and thus many valuable objects were re-deposited
in deep water along with the dredged mud. It was reported that some
bronze objects had been sold to the smith, Vossech, and melted; while
others of stone and horn had been dispersed. It appears also that at a
particular place called the Baumhaus piles of oak had been observed.
In 1864 the workmen engaged at the dredging machines, having their
attention called to the matter, reported the existence of piles at
various places in the bay, one of which was between the shore and the
little island Wallfisch, and the other close to the island Poel. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
peculiar horn object which had been sent to the museum was supposed to
have been a <i>Taschenbügel</i> or rim for a pouch.
(B. 100, p. 101, and vol. xxix. p. 132.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bützow.</span>&mdash;There was also, according
to Dr. Lisch, a lake-dwelling in a turf moor called the "Sühring,"
near the town of Bützow. Here at a given place near the margin of the
moor the peat-cutters were occasionally finding antiquities associated
with piles, which, on being sent to the Schwerin Museum, led to the
recognition of the true character of the find. Over 60 objects were
collected, among which Dr. Lisch enumerates the following:&mdash;two
round stone rubbers, three semilunar flint saws, a flint celt, a
perforated axe-head, a bronze pin three and a half inches long,
several objects of horn and bone, a piece of reindeer horn, and shells
of hazel-nuts. (B. 142.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vimfou.</span>&mdash;Dr. Weichmann-Kadow (B.
142) describes a lacustrine dwelling found in a small lake at Vimfou,
near Goldberg. The lake was drained and converted into meadow land
in 1865, and in its former bed three localities containing piles
had been observed, only one of which, however, was subjected to any
examination. This was near the middle of the lake, and the piles,
which appeared to have been the foundations of a burnt-down hut,
occupied a circular area about 12 feet in diameter. Inside the piled
area were bits of burnt wood, charcoal, and some broken pottery and
three whole vessels. Some of these vessels were well made and had
handles and a style of ornamentation which corresponded with the
early Iron Age. The only other remains were a few grinding stones
(<i>Quetschmühle</i>), some small round pebbles supposed to have been
used as draughtsmen, bits of bone, and the shells of hazel-nuts.</p>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">b</span>) POMERANIA AND CENTRAL PRUSSIA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ryck.</span>&mdash;Almost contemporary with
Lisch's discoveries in the vicinity of Wismar were those by Von
Hagenow at the mouth of the river Wiek. (B. 97.) Rumours of the
discovery of various ancient objects of flint, bronze, and iron, while
the bed of the river was being deepened, induced Mr. von Hagenow to
investigate the matter. These reported discoveries extended backwards
for upwards of twenty years, embracing the years 1839-47-59-62 and
'64. It was only in the latter year that it became surmised that the
antiquities indicated a lake-dwelling. There was no doubt of the
existence of piles, which Von Hagenow unhesitatingly concluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
had been used for this purpose; but others thought they were
the remains of a bridge. Prof. Virchow, writing in 1869 (B. 165),
after examining into all the circumstances, was unable to form an
opinion or to decide whether these remains pointed to a bridge or
to a lake-dwelling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hegar Lake.</span>&mdash;This lake is situated
in the district of Dramburg, near Sabin, and in it were found many
iron objects, upwards of 100 arrow and lance-heads, spurs and
horse-bits, associated with the remains of a small wooden house. No
objects characteristic of the Stone or Bronze Ages were found, so that
there can be no doubt that this station was of a comparatively late age.
(B. 119, 2nd ed., p. 629.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werbelinsee.</span>&mdash;According to
Professor Virchow, this lake contains the remains of a most
interesting pile-dwelling. (B. 165.) The lake is situated not far from
Joachimsthal and Angermünde, and on its south side, near the village
of Altenhof, piles were detected which, by a vague tradition, were
supposed to mark the site of a bridge. Professor Virchow, however, by
placing long wooden poles in the water where the submerged ancient
piles were observed, demonstrated the existence of a vast area which
even the sceptical boatmen admitted could only have been intended for
the foundations of a village.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Persanzigersee.</span>&mdash;This lake,
according to Kasiski (B. 125 and 362), is situated four and a half
miles to the west of Neustettin, and formerly covered about 186 acres;
but in 1863 it was lowered some 10 feet by the construction of a
drainage canal, thereby reducing its area to less than as many roods.
At the north end of the lake, and 170 yards from the shore, there
appeared a small island, which was found to have been surrounded by
a remarkable structure of piles and cross-beams. Sixty yards to the
north of this island there was a flat prominence, called the "Werder,"
which was completely cut off from the mainland, partly by bogs and
partly by an arm of the lake 55 yards wide.
(See accompanying <a href="#Map_12">Sketch Map</a>.)</p>

<p>Stretching between the island and the point of the Werder
the stumps of a double row of piles, doubtless the remains of a
bridge, were detected. A similar bridge also extended from the
Werder to the shore; and to the south of this were the remains of
a third bridge, which appears to have never been finished, as
it stopped suddenly short after reaching some 40 yards into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
lake in the direction of the island. Another row of piles, commencing
at the outer end of the bridge which connected the island with the
Werder, extended circularly for a considerable distance in the bed
of the lake, as if intended to protect the island.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Map_12" id="Map_12"></a>
  <img src="images/i_354.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="232" />
</div>

<p class="space-above1">The chief point of interest, however, lay in
the peculiar structures which surrounded the island. These consisted
of a series of rectangles, some 60 in number, formed of horizontal
beams 16 feet long and 8 to 12 inches in diameter; they overlapped
each other near their extremities, leaving about 18 inches free, and
each beam had deep cuts by which it was kept in position, exactly
similar to the plan used in the construction of a log house. The
rectangular spaces measured four or five square yards, and had 30 or
40 piles placed on both sides of the chamber-walls, apparently for
the purpose of strengthening the horizontal beams, as shown in the
plan. These chambers appear to have formed a complete girdle to the
island, but they were partly destroyed on the south side. The quantity
of wood used was enormous, as the piles alone numbered about 1800. On
the north side the structures were remarkably well preserved, being
protected by a covering of slime and rushes eight to twelve inches
thick. At first Major Kasiski believed that the rectangles were
cottages, but subsequently, after comparison with similar structures
in other lakes in North Germany, he came to the conclusion that they
formed merely the submerged foundations over which the cottages had
been built.</p>

<p>The bridges from the Insel to the Werder, and from the
Werder to the shore, were built on two rows of piles, 8 feet apart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
and the piles in each row were about 7 feet apart. Major Kasiski
inferred from the remains of the unfinished bridge, which showed
the use of tenons and mortises, that it was of later date than the others.</p>

<p>Among the relics collected on the island or amidst its surrounding
structures are two halves of an upper quern, 14&frac12; inches in
diameter and 5 inches thick. The under side is concave, and the centre
hole, which has a diameter of 1&frac14; inches, widens upwards like a
funnel. Querns have been found in several lake-dwellings
in North Germany, as Gägelow, Wismar, and Cottbus, in Neumark.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Other relics consist of wooden clubs, two portions of leather,
a skate made of the leg-bone of a horse, staghorn hammers, five
sharpening-stones, a few spindle-whorls of stone and clay, a bit of
coral, seven portions of worked wood&mdash;a shovel, rudder, etc.
Of metal there are a fragment of bronze and an iron hatchet. The
latter implement is small, measuring only 3&frac12; inches long, and
2&frac12; inches wide at its cutting-edge, and has a round hole for
the handle.</p>

<p>The pottery, of which 45 fragments were collected, was made of fine
clay, by means of the potter's-wheel, and from the variety of its
ornamentation and characteristic wavy lines, there can be no doubt
that it belonged to the type of the Burgwälle&mdash;an inference
which is greatly strengthened by its resemblance to that found in the
Wallberg in the Raddatzsee, a noted Burgwall situated in the close
vicinity. Illustrations of a few specimens of this pottery are given
on <b><a href="#Fig_96">Fig. 96</a></b>, Nos. 6 to 9.</p>

<p>From an examination of the bones collected the following animals
were identified, viz.:&mdash;horse, ox, goat, sheep, pig, dog, fox,
deer, and roe.</p>

<p>In the Virchowsee a little to the north of Persanzig there is a
huge Burgwall surrounded by water, in which the remains of piles have
been found. (B. 165.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Streitzigsee.</span>&mdash;On the lowering
of this lake a very large assortment of piles became exposed, but
although several excavations were made, both by Professor Virchow and
others, no decided results were obtained bearing on their character
and scope. (B. 165.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lübtowsee.</span>&mdash;Another locality which
has furnished remains of pile-dwellings lies to the right of the Oder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
in the vicinity of Lübtow. (B. 165.) Here the river Plöne traverses
a long lake, and on its being lowered in 1859, an extensive area
covered with piles became visible towards its northern end. It is
said that many relics were found among these piles, some of which
were collected by the proprietor; but the idea of their belonging to
lake-dwellings was not mooted till several years afterwards. Professor
Virchow visited the locality in 1865, and again in 1869, and on the
latter occasion he made extensive excavations, which convinced him
that this was a regular lake-settlement. Later on the foundations of a
quadrangular wooden building came to light, from which, owing to its
being 3 feet under the late lake level, Mr. Kühne inferred that the
lake must have formerly stood at a lower level. That this structure,
however, as well as the piles, belonged to the Iron Age, he says there
can be no doubt whatever, as the antiquities collected in both were
precisely similar, being generally iron objects, such as swords, lance
and arrow-heads, stirrups, spurs, knives, and bricks of the thirteenth
or fourteenth century. In the rectangular building, in addition to
such objects, were found a helmet and greaves. But what was considered
still more singular, there was found among the piles a number of
stone chisels and hammers, together with one bronze celt.
(B. 119, 2<sup>o</sup> ed., p. 629.)</p>

<p>Adjacent to this lake at Bonin, and deeply buried in the turf,
indications of wooden structures came to light which, in 1872,
attracted the attention of Professor Virchow, who, in company with
the local antiquaries, made excavations which revealed structures
analogous to those in the Persanzigersee. (B. 227.) In excavating they
passed through the following distinct layers:&mdash;First, 5 to 8 feet
of peat; second, some thin layers of marl, sand, and mud; and third,
a relic-bed, 2 to 4 feet in thickness. The woodwork appeared to the
investigators to have been cut by sharp metal tools. Among the relics
collected were four sharpening-stones, a few perforated staghorn
hammers, a bone chisel 6&frac12; inches long, some large horn handles,
a small iron knife, bits of leather, fragments of wooden dishes, and
part of a boat. Pottery was also found which belonged to the Burgwälle type.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soldinersee.</span>&mdash;In 1857 this lake
was lowered 7 to 8 feet, when two islands became visible, one of
which turned out to be the site of a lake-dwelling, and yielded a
considerable number of antiquities, among which was portion of a
reindeer horn. (B. 165, p. 407.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1873 Major Kamienski examined it with greater care, and
published a short notice of the results. (B. 241.) The island was
150 yards from the shore, and measured 85 by 30 yards. It contained
many piles, and showed no evidence of having been destroyed by fire.
The relics were of a mixed character. With flint flakes and broken
stone-axes were various iron objects, as a hook, a spear-head,
three knife-blades, and three halves of horseshoes. There were also
arrow-points of bone, two portions of bows, a clay spindle-whorl, a
bone shuttle, beautifully worked, and a piece of horn with a kind
of ornamentation cut on it. The fragments of pottery also indicated
different kinds. Stones, which looked as if they had been exposed to
fire, were supposed to have been used as hearths. Among the osseous
remains were those of the ox, pig, stag, roe, fox, bear, beaver, wild
boar, and a single vertebra of a fish.</p>

<p>A Burgwall was on the land near the lake-dwelling&mdash;a fact
which is somewhat significant, as, according to Virchow, there was
often a close connection between these two classes of remains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dabersee</span> (<span class="smcap">Hinter
Pommern</span>).&mdash;The Pfahlbauten in this lake were shown by
Professor Virchow to be connected with an adjacent Burgwall by a
wooden bridge. (B. 165.) He also found that the piles were associated
with submerged wooden rectangles similar to those already described
in the Persanzigersee. Together with pottery of the Burgwälle type,
he found bone skates, an iron hatchet, and an ornamented comb,
constructed of several pieces of bone banded together with iron
rivets. About this comb he remarks that the teeth were sawn after the
pieces were put together&mdash;a peculiarity which I have noted of the
bone combs found on the Ayrshire crannogs.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lübbinchenersee</span> (<span class="smcap">Kr. Guben</span>).&mdash;In
1877 a lake-dwelling of the Slavish period (<i>Spätwendischer und
darüber Mittelalterlicher Pfahlbau</i>) was examined by members of the
Märkisches Museum, in Berlin, from which they collected a large
quantity of iron objects, pottery, bones, etc., which may now be seen
in this museum. The base of this lacustrine dwelling was constructed
precisely similar to that at Persanzig, and the beams had similar cuts
near their extremities, where they overlapped each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Alt Friesack</span> (<span class="smcap">Kr. Ruppin</span>).&mdash;A
similar Slavish Pfahlbau was found at Alt Friesack, from which
there is now in the Märkisches Museum a large quantity of
<i>débris</i>&mdash;wooden beams, quern-stones, some perforated clay
sinkers (<b><a href="#Fig_96">Fig. 96</a></b>, No. 5), an iron hatchet (No. 2) with
traces of ornamentation on it, an iron oblong ring (No. 1), and pottery with
the characteristic wavy lines (Nos. 3 and 4).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Kloppsee</span> (<span class="smcap">Neumark</span>).&mdash;A
lake-dwelling in the Kloppsee, near Woldenburg, has yielded a fine
black pottery, so well burnt that it gives a metallic ring when
struck. The vessels found here are well shaped, and the fragments
show handles, feet, and well-formed recurved rims. (B. 165.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spandau.</span>&mdash;One of the most
remarkable lacustrine discoveries in North Germany was made a few
years ago (1881) at the town of Spandau, near Berlin. Here, in a flat
space called Stresow, close to the river Havel, in which workmen were
excavating the foundations of a military powder-house, oak piles and
bronze weapons were turned up from considerable depths.</p>

<p>The locality was almost surrounded by the adjacent sluggish
waters, and so wet that two pumps had to be kept going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
before the men could carry out the necessary excavations.
From the sedimentary character of the deposit, as well as the
abundance of fresh-water shells, there could be no doubt that
formerly the place had been occupied by a lake. There was,
first of all, a bed of peat about five feet thick, and under
this came a deposit of mud and sand. On the south side of the
space being excavated there was observed at a depth of nearly
12 feet a layer of greenish stuff, mixed with bones, impregnated
with vivianite, and through this layer the piles were found
to have penetrated to the sand underneath. It was in the
muddy deposit immediately beneath the peat that the tops of
the piles appeared, and they were arranged sometimes in
parallel rows, and sometimes without any apparent regularity.
Some were of oak, and others of soft wood. There was also
much timber lying transversely, and many of the beams showed
signs of charring.</p>

<p>The relics were collected between and around these piles, and
uniformly all over the area. They consisted of a remarkable series
of bronze implements and weapons, together with a few of stone
and horn. There were also found the bones of tame and wild
animals, a human brachycephalic skull and some other human
bones, a portion of a canoe, and a very small quantity of pottery
of an indeterminate character. The bones were very much broken,
but, notwithstanding, they were identified as belonging to the
following animals, viz.:&mdash;stag, roe, hare, bear, ox, horse,
pig, and dog. It is noteworthy that the reindeer and elk were
both unrepresented.</p>

<p><i>Relics.</i>&mdash;It is, however, the relics that distinguish this
lacustrine find from others in North Germany, and these I shall now
describe shortly:&mdash;three swords with handles (<b><a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a></b>,
Nos. 8, 9, and 10), one sword-blade attached by rivets (No. 11); an
ornamented <i>commandostab</i> (No. 18), and a small button-like object,
ornamented with a running scroll of double spiral; three daggers have
rivet-marks and one has a tang (Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 12); one dagger,
still in its bronze handle (No. 13), has its butt end ornamented with
concentric circles and spirals characteristic of the Scandinavian
archæological area; two lance-heads with sockets (Nos. 4 and 17), one
of which is ornamented with lines and crossbars (No. 17); one socketed
celt (No. 3); five paalstabs (Nos. 1 and 2); and a piece of bronze wire.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Of stone objects there were two round grindstones or polishers
(No. 15) and some sharpening stones, a polished perforated stone
(No. 16), a portion of a hammer of greenstone, and a round stone
ball 4 inches in diameter, like a cannon-ball.</p>

<p>Five staghorn axe-heads, a disc of horn perforated, a portion of
a horn spear, five bits of rough unornamented pottery, and a large
perforated ball of clay. Fragments of a canoe showing a length of
10 feet. Report goes that an iron implement, and a portion of a dish
like earthenware of the twelfth century, were found; but probably
they had no connection with the bronze objects above described.
It is noteworthy that all the relics are of a military character,
there being among them no spindle-whorls, combs, hair-pins, fibulæ,
bracelets, or any other objects that can be said to belong to
domestic life. For this reason this lacustrine abode is generally
supposed to have been a military fort like La Tène. (B. 384 and 396.)</p>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">c</span>) POSEN AND POLAND.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Objezierze.</span>&mdash;In the province
of Posen there are several localities to be recorded which have
yielded unequivocal indications of lake-dwellings, two of which,
viz. Objezierze and Czeszewo, are supposed by local archæologists to
date as far back as the Stone Age. The former existed in a swamp now
filled up with peat, which has thus preserved and concealed piles and
other remains recently brought to light by peat-cutters. The relics
collected from this place are now deposited in the Posen Archæological
Museum, and among them I have noted the following:&mdash;A few
remarkably fine knife-flakes of flint, one of which is 7&frac12;
inches long, a perforated bead, four large clay rings (<b><a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a></b>,
No. 8), and three flint celts of the Scandinavian type (No. 7). In the
same turf moor and in the vicinity of the lake-dwelling was found a
large bronze torque ornamented as shown in No. 9.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Czeszewo</span> (<span class="smcap">Kr. Wagrowice</span>).&mdash;Although
for many years the existence of piles in a particular spot in this
lake was known to fishermen, it was not till 1871 that their true
nature was recognised by Professor Lepkowsky of Krakow. The lake was
surrounded by marshy borders and peat bogs, and at various times its
level was lowered, which thus considerably reduced its area. Firewood
being scarce in the district, the fishermen were in the habit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
pulling out the piles, and in this way the structures were greatly
damaged before a competent archæologist saw them. The site of the
Pfahlbau was near a large tumulus constructed close to the original
lake margin. The area occupied by the piles was in the form of a
segment of a circle, the base of which was 250 paces long and its
greatest breadth 75. Transverse beams from 10 to 12 feet long were
found interspersed among the uprights, which were supposed to have
bound the latter together, though neither wedges nails, nor mortises
were detected. It was observed that the uprights had their tops
charred and that the portions remaining were longer the farther
they were placed from the shore, and hence it was supposed that the
dwelling had been destroyed by a conflagration.</p>

<p>The remains of human industry collected from this station are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
now deposited partly in the Jagellon Museum at Krakow, and partly
in the Archæological Museum at Posen. Among them are fragments of
pottery, one being part of a dish perforated with small holes
(<b><a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a></b>, No. 5), perforated stone and horn hammers and
axes (Nos. 1 and 2), one or two plain celts (No. 6), some fragments of clay rings
(No. 3), two fragments of human skulls, and a large quantity of the osseous
remains of different animals. One object of bronze is said to have
been found on this station, and one of the stone implements is only
partially perforated, the operation having been unfinished. The stone
objects are made of dark granite.</p>

<p>Messrs. Kohn and Mehlis have published a small photographic view
of the objects in the Krakow Museum, but the more interesting ones,
though fewer in number, are at Posen, from which the illustrations
here shown are taken. Notices of this lake-dwelling have been
published by Count Przezdiecki (B. 156 and 195), by Kohn and Mehlis
(B. 338), and by Ossowski of Krakow (B. 361)&mdash;the last being in
Polish and French.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grossesee.</span>&mdash;At Alt-Gortzig, in
the Grossesee, there was a small island which became visible on the
lowering of the lake some 10 feet, around which were found piles and
the usual <i>débris</i> of a lacustrine dwelling, among which were pottery
with parallel and wavy lines, charcoal, and an iron axe-head, together
with numerous osseous remains. (B. 228 and 352.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pawlowice.</span>&mdash;Mr. Schwartz, of
Posen, describes what he considers to have been a lake-dwelling near
Pawlowice. Here, in a turf-moor which had formerly been a lake, he
found, at a depth of five feet, bits of clay plaster, hearth-stones,
fragments of cooking vessels, etc.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Also at Komorowo, in the Bythinersee, indications of lake-dwellings
have been found.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lagiewnicki.</span>&mdash;Another interesting
locality, discovered a few years ago, is at Lagiewnicki (Posen).
Here the tops of oak piles were found at a depth of five feet in
the peat, and associated with them were fragments of two kinds of
pottery&mdash;one rough, like that used in the manufacture of urns,
and the other of the Burgwälle type. Among the relics were a wooden
mallet, a perforated bone implement, some flint flakes, the pin of a
bronze fibula of La Tène type (<b><a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a></b>, No. 11), and a silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
necklace (No. 10), terminating at one end in a raised button
which clasped with an eye at the other when fastened. (B. 430.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kwaczala.</span>&mdash;At the request of
the Academy of Sciences of Krakow, Mr. Adam Kirkor, curator of
the Archæological Museum at Wilna, investigated, in the summer of
1873, a peat-moor near the village of Kwaczala, said to contain
pile-dwellings. Mr. Kirkor found beams and piles in several spots
pointed out by the proprietor, where the peat-cutters were said to
have formerly encountered woodwork. Water came upon his trenches at
a depth of three feet. Both upright and transverse beams of oak were
found, some being over a yard in circumference and 8&frac12; yards
long. The area containing structural remains of woodwork was 70 yards
long by 40 broad. The foundation was of horizontal beams, spread out
in all directions, which he concluded to have been arranged after
some kind of architectural principle. There was a large quantity of
rude pottery, some showing linear or punctured ornamentation. Two
perforated axe-hammer heads of stone, and about 300 bits of worked
flint were collected among the <i>débris</i>, as well as some bones of
the horse. Altogether, this primitive habitation appears to have been
of a peculiar kind. (B. 338.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bialka</span> (<span class="smcap">Lubliner
Kr.</span>).&mdash;In the moor of Bialka, formerly covered with
water, there is a small island about 100 paces in diameter, on which
tradition says there was once an enchanted castle. Professor Joseph
Przyborowski, of Warsaw, made some excavations on the island, and
found on the surface some tiles and modern implements, which so far
confirmed the tradition of the ancient castle; but upon digging he
came upon wooden piles at a depth of four feet. His excavations
extended some twenty feet long and nine feet wide, and in the whole
of this area he found numbers of piles, as well as cross-beams.
Associated with these wooden structures there was also a relic-bed,
entirely distinct from the superficial layer, on which he found two
well-formed flint arrow-heads, a portion of a perforated axe of
serpentine, some flint implements, and broken bones of edible animals.
If this site were properly investigated the author prognosticated
results of considerable scientific value. (B. 338.)</p>

<p>Professor Ossowski, in his "Carte Archéologique" (B. 361),
gives the following sites of lake-dwellings, none of which, however,
have been carefully investigated:&mdash;(1) <i>Warlubie</i> (Kr. Swieć).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
This is a vast peat deposit from which neolithic implements and
staghorn hammers have been extracted from time to time. It was visited
by Ossowski in the year 1878, who found some fragments of pottery
and charcoal. But these merely strengthened the suspicion that the
antiquities were due to Pfahlbauten. (2) Similar indications were
found at <i>Kowalewo</i>, in the district of Tornú. (3) At <i>Wabrzeźno</i>,
in the district of Chelmno, there is a small lake, in which were found
a primitive vase, a bronze fish-hook, a stone hammer, and an implement
of staghorn. (4) <i>Lankorsz</i>, district of Lubawa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aryssee.</span>&mdash;The existence of the
<i>débris</i> of a remarkable lake-dwelling in the Aryssee became known in
1863, in consequence of the discontinuance of a mill which had its
motive power supplied by the surplus water from this lake, and the
subsequent deepening of its outlet, which had the effect of lowering
its level about seven feet. Its remains have been investigated
and described by various persons, notably Professor Heydeck, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Königsberg, who has made plans and models of its peculiar structure.
These, as well as a large collection of relics, are now deposited in
the Prussia Museum at Königsberg. It appears to have been a kind of
<i>Packwerk</i>. There were, first of all, two or three layers of round
timbers lying transversely to each other on the bottom of the lake in
the form of rectangles, after which their sides only were continued
upwards by single beams, laid successively on each side, thus leaving
empty spaces above. These horizontal beams were kept in position by
numerous uprights, which here and there flanked them on both sides, as
well as by deep cuts towards their extremities where they overlapped
each other, precisely similar to the plan adopted at Persanzig and
elsewhere. This understructure had a thickness of three to four feet,
and over it was laid a wooden platform, above which the huts of its
inhabitants were constructed. Clay floorings were found over these
platforms, with evidences here and there of fire-places. The relics
were found both on the platform and in the originally empty spaces,
which, of course, were now filled up with <i>débris</i>. Upon its first
appearance there was a layer of from 1&frac12; to 2 feet of mud over
the woodwork, but after its exposure for some time the mud dried and
became greatly contracted. The central area of this structure measured
72 by 36 feet, and was surrounded by three rows of piles. A bridge or
gangway, also constructed on a triple row of piles, extended to the
shore, a distance of about fifty yards.</p>

<p>At first, and for several years after its discovery, no metal
objects were found, and hence it was supposed to belong exclusively
to the Stone Age; but this is no longer the case, as latterly it has
furnished both iron and bronze objects.</p>

<p>Among the relics are the following:&mdash;fragments of an iron
socketed lance-head 4 inches long, a large bronze button 1&frac34;
inch in diameter, and a portion of cast bronze. Wooden hooks, like
those from Robenhausen, and perforated square bits, supposed to have
been floats for nets. Fragments of pottery and some whole dishes, the
largest being 18 inches high, showing nail and finger marks
(<b><a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a></b>, No. 11), perforated rims (No. 10), and
sometimes handles. A few flakes, arrow-points, and scrapers of flint (Nos. 8 and 9).
Fragment of a perforated axe-hammer of diorite and some mealing
stones. Six perforated horn axes, the largest 6&frac12; inches long;
pointers, pins, two needles, and various other objects of bone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
(Nos. 1 to 7). Arrow-points of bone are 3 to 4 inches long, and
scrapers 1&frac12; to 3&frac12; inches. Portions of roofing thatch of
rushes, clay flooring, etc.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Czarnisee and Tulewosee.</span>&mdash;These
two lakes are in the vicinity of the Aryssee, and each contained a
lake-dwelling similar to that in the latter, both in structure and
in the character of its relics. On the station in the Czarnisee were
found a blue glass bead; a partially perforated stone axe, 3⅛ inches long,
with the core still remaining; and two socketed iron lance-heads.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Kownatken</span> Pfahlbau was also a
Packwerk formed of round and split stems. It extended along the margin
of the lake for about seventy paces, and had a breadth of twelve at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the east end, which became reduced to seven or eight at the west
end. Some of the pottery from this station, of which fragments of
twelve vessels were found, was ornamented with finger marks as well
as string marks (<i>Schnurornament</i>). Among the relics are pointers of
bone, one supposed to be a skate (<b><a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a></b>, No. 14);
some round sling-stones; a well-formed stone hatchet (No. 12); worked flint
flakes (No. 13); and sharpening stones. Among the bones were those of
the stag, roe, pig, horse, ox, and portions of reindeer horn.</p>

<p>The lacustrine dwelling in the <span class="smcap">Kocksee</span>
was discovered on the lowering of the lake in the autumn of 1882.
When its level had sunk 4&frac12; feet, the structure appeared above
the water. It was 34 yards long by 15 broad, and stretched lengthways
along the shore, with which it was connected by a bridge. The woodwork
appeared to have been cut by metal tools, although none of them have
hitherto been discovered in the <i>débris</i>. The relics consisted of
fragments of pottery and a few stone and bone objects.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring <span class="smcap">Probchensee</span> a
lake-dwelling, in all respects similar to that in the Kocksee, has
recently come to light.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Bonslack</span> transverse beams
were observed, tied to the uprights by means of birch thongs
(<i>Birkengeflecht</i>). From this station, some pottery, perforated
like a sieve, and a mallet of wood, are recorded.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Szontagsee</span> there was also a
lake-dwelling of the same class as those above described, the exact
details of which have not yet been published. From it there are
several interesting objects in the Prussia Museum at Königsberg, among
which I have noted bone pointers and spatulæ, a well-formed needle of
bone with the eye at one end, and a large bronze button with a raised eye.</p>

<p>As to the other localities in East Prussia where indications of
lake-dwellings have been observed, the discoveries hitherto made on
their sites are too indefinite to merit a detailed notice here, and
I shall content myself with the references already given as to where
such observations have been recorded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arraschsee</span>
(<span class="smcap">Livland</span>).&mdash;In 1876 Count Sievers
announced the discovery of a lake-dwelling in the Arraschsee, which was
subsequently visited by the indefatigable Professor Virchow. This was
a small circular island, covered with birch trees and bushes, which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
on examination, turned out to have been an artificially-constructed
island, like our own crannogs. Like them, also, it was surrounded by
piles, and its interior was constructed of layers of wooden beams laid
transversely over each other. Its structure was ascertained by digging
two large square holes in different parts of the island, and in one
nine layers of wood were counted, and in the other six. The chief
relics collected were a bronze ring-pin, seven inches long; a bronze
fibula (<i>eine lettische Fibel</i>); portion of a mould; a few clay beads;
a pointed bone implement; bits of string and rolls of birch-bark; also
fragments of grey and black pottery, with rude knobs and finger-marks,
and without handles. From marks on the woodwork it was inferred that
iron tools were used. The osseous remains belonged to the horse, ox,
pig, and beaver. (B. 292.)</p>

<h3>General Remarks on the Lake-Dwellings of North Germany.</h3>

<p>Professor Virchow, as early as 1869, published an excellent
thesis on the lake-dwellings of North Germany (B. 165), in which he
maintained that all of them, with perhaps one or two exceptions,
belonged to a much more recent period than those of Switzerland
and South Germany. This opinion he founded on the following
considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Though many objects of stone and bronze were found on the
former, yet in almost every case they were associated with others
of a more recent type, including iron implements, etc.</p>

<p>(2) The food refuse contained most commonly the bones of the
ordinary domestic animals, those of wild animals, such as reindeer,
wild boar, stag, wild goat, and beaver, being but rarely met with.</p>

<p>(3) Many of the lake-dwellings were synchronous with the Burgwälle,
a fact which was conclusively proved by their possessing the
characteristic pottery of the latter, as was notably the case in the
Persanzig lake-dwelling. Moreover, Virchow showed that some of the
Burgwälle had direct communication with adjacent lake-dwellings,
as in the Dabersee, Soldinersee, and Kloppsee.</p>

<p>Referring to this subject at a later date (1877), at the eighth
Congress of the German Anthropological Society (B. 306), Virchow,
while reviewing the further discoveries of lake-dwellings in North
Germany, maintained the general correctness of his previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
conclusions. These northern Pfahlbauten, according to him, were due
to the immigration into the country of the Slavish people, and bear
the same relation to the Burgwälle that the pile-dwellings in Italy do
to the terremare. "Ich denke," says he, "wir werden uns entschliessen
müssen, ganz im Gegensatze zu den süddeutschschweizerischen
Pfahlbauten, die Einführung der nördlichen Pfahlbauten an die
Einwanderung des Slavo-lettischen Stammes anzuknüpfen."</p>

<p>Virchow's opinion is not, however, universally accepted, as
many of the local archæologists maintain that there are several
lake-dwellings which have yielded relics that can only be explained on
the supposition that they were founded during the earlier prehistoric
ages. The chief examples relied on in support of their contention are
those at Wismar, Spandau, Czeszewo, Objezierze, and Aryssee.</p>

<p>After carefully examining the relics from all these stations I must
admit that much could be written on both sides of this controversy.
Notwithstanding the number of typical objects of the Stone Age from
Wismar and Gägelow, Dr. Lisch records that along with them were
portions of querns. Now, querns are never found among the remains
of the Swiss lake-dwellings, nor am I aware of their existence in
any prehistoric remains in northern or western Europe prior to Roman
times. The station at Spandau, if it be considered a true Pfahlbau,
was undoubtedly of the Bronze Age. Czeszewo and Objezierze have
yielded a considerable quantity of Stone Age relics, with scarcely
any of the succeeding ages. Only one bronze object is said to have
been found on the former, and from the latter there is in the Museum
of Posen a bronze torque (<b><a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a></b>, No. 9), which
was found at a little distance from the lake-dwelling. As regards the Aryssee
and its neighbouring lakes of Czarni and Tulewo, with their respective
lake-dwellings, all of which are of the <i>Packwerk</i> type, Professor
Heydeck relies largely on the presence of pottery with string and
finger ornamentation, as a proof of their antiquity, in addition
to the ordinary stone celts, horn clubs, etc.; but yet along with
them were found iron lance-heads and a blue glass bead (Czarnisee).
Similarly in the <i>Packwerk</i> in the Kownatkensee, polished stone
celts, pottery with finger marks and <i>Schnurornament</i>, and portion
of a reindeer horn, were found associated with a bone skate, and the
osseous remains of the domestic animals, as the horse, pig,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
ox, etc. In attempting, therefore, to estimate the chronological
range of these lake-dwellings from an examination of their contents,
which (being unnoticed in the early annals of the country) is the
only available means, the mixed character of these relics presents
a considerable difficulty&mdash;a difficulty which, as we shall
afterwards see, is equally applicable to the Scottish and Irish
crannogs. But, whatever doubts may be cast on their antiquity and
early origin, there can be none as to the comparatively late occupancy
of many of them. A bone skate and a comb made of square bits bound
together by cross pieces, and showing that the teeth were cut by a saw
after the pieces were put together, precisely as may be seen in the
combs from the Scottish crannogs and the terp-mounds of Holland, were
found by Virchow in the Dabersee Pfahlbau. Iron hatchets (Dabersee,
Persanzigsee, and Alt Friesack), horseshoes, and other iron implements
(Soldinersee), pottery of Slavish type (Bonin, Kloppsee, Persanzig,
etc.), leather (Bonin), and even armour and bricks of the thirteenth
century (Lübtowsee), leave no doubt as to their almost mediæval character.</p>

<p>Reindeer horns were found at Butzow, Soldinersee, and Kownatkensee;
but these objects do not necessarily indicate great antiquity, as this
animal, though not referred to in the early annals of North Germany,
is stated to have been an inhabitant of the country in the time of Cæsar.</p>

<p>The undoubted contemporaneity of many of these lake-dwellings with
the Burgwälle opens up a field of research of considerable importance
to European archæology; but their exact chronological relationship
still remains an obscure problem, owing chiefly to the mystery which
surrounds the latter.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> <i>Burgwälle</i> or <i>Rundwälle</i> is the general
name given to the remains of a remarkable class of prehistoric
constructions found scattered over the larger portion of middle and
north-western Europe, embracing the southern parts of Russia around
the shores of the Black Sea, Roumania, Bulgaria, Transylvania,
Hungary, Austria, Bohemia, Poland, North Germany, France, Great
Britain, and the southern parts of Scandinavia. Their foundations
now only remain and these show that the structures were generally
circular or oval, but sometimes square and semicircular. They may be
divided into three kinds, according to the materials of which their
foundations are constructed, viz.:&mdash;earth, stones or stones
in vitrified condition (<i>Erd-, Stein-und Schlackenwälle</i>). Their
sizes vary from 20 to 100 paces in diameter, and their height from
10 to 30 feet, and they contained one, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> two, or sometimes
three walls. Those made of earth were circular and generally situated
in swampy land, or in countries where stones were not readily
accessible. The Steinwälle were in hilly districts and varied in form
according to the nature of the ground. Sometimes they assumed the
irregular outline of a promontory or peninsula in a lake, at other
times, especially when placed on an overhanging cliff, they were mere
semicircles. Those of vitrified materials are of special interest
to Scottish archæologists owing to the number of vitrified forts in
Scotland. They are not very numerous on the Continent, Saxony and
Bohemia containing the largest number. In the former country eight
are known, viz.:&mdash;Schafberg by Löbau, Rothstein by Sohland,
Stromberg by Weissenberg, Landeskrone by Görlitz, Brandwall by
Blumberg, Koschütz near Dresden, Burgberg by Lichtenberg, and Vorberg
by Kirchberg. According to Jelinek, Bohemia is rich in Schlackenwälle,
those best known being near Katovic, Bukovec, Litoradic, Hradiste von
Hostem, Hradiste bei Strakonic, Hradec bei Domanic Burgberg, Vladar,
etc. ("Schutz-und Wehrbauten." p. 102). Instances also occur in
Silesia, Thuringian Forest, Rhine district, Brittany, and Normandy.</p>

<p>The Burgwälle, like their analogues in the British Isles, have
not yet been systematically investigated. From the character of
the relics found in those that have been explored in North Germany
they are divided into <i>Vorslavisch</i>, <i>Slavisch</i> and <i>Spätslavisch</i>,
a distinction which has been suggested by the unique character of
Slavish pottery. These Slavish dishes are always without handles,
but of well-burnt pottery, and when ornamented the ornamentation is
in wavy lines running parallel to the rim forming the characteristic
<i>Wellenlinie</i>.</p>

<p>Many of these remains have, of course, now entirely disappeared in
the interests of agriculture, but their number still remaining is very
great. In Eastern Germany Dr. R. Behla describes and tabulates no
fewer than 1,100. They are more numerous in the fertile districts. In
Oberlausitz, in one district measuring 9 miles long by 3 to 16 broad,
they number 100, and in the neighbourhood of Bautzen within a one mile
circle 20 can be counted.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that the material used in the upper structures of
the Burgwälle was wood, which, of course, has now completely decayed,
except in some special conditions, as in swampy ground where wooden
piles were used in their foundations. This is another point of
contact between these buildings and the lake-dwellings which has not
been overlooked by archæologists. Virchow describes the Burgwall of
Potzlow, and that of Zahsow near Cottbus, as constructed over former Pfahlbauten;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
and, indeed, the town of Cottbus seems to have been altogether built over
piles, as, wherever diggings have been made, piles are met with, and in
this way a finely ornamented quern was found.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
Wooden substructures, in the form of a platform or <i>Packwerkbau</i>,
have also been observed and recorded in many places, as at Schlieben,
Gross Topola (Posen), the Labenzsee, Westpreussen.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
Moreover, those in boggy places were approached by means of wooden
gangways, the remains of which have been frequently met with in the
form of a double row of piles.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<h3>ANCIENT MARINE DWELLINGS ON THE COASTS OF<br />HOLLAND AND WESTERN GERMANY.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the striking and singular appearance the Swiss
lake-dwellings must have presented to foreigners and strangers, it
is a remarkable fact that Roman writers are entirely silent about
them. Nor can this silence be accounted for on the supposition that
the lake-dwellings had entirely come to an end prior to Roman times,
as several of them have furnished antiquities whose Roman origin
cannot be mistaken. Some archæologists think they recognise in the
representation of a Dacian village on the Column of Trajan a true
pile-village (B. 164); but this is doubtful, and, even if true, it is
but a very meagre evidence of the custom, and leaves the problem of
the lake-dwellings as mysterious as ever. Such reticence on the part
of classical writers does not, however, extend to the class of ancient
remains I am now about to describe.</p>

<p>Pliny very distinctly states that the Chauci (Frisians and other
races along the coast of the German Ocean) were in the habit of
constructing artificial mounds, on which they built their houses
so as to be beyond the influence of the waves and tides.
The following passage from his "Natural History"<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
will be read with interest in relation to the recent discoveries
that have been made in the localities referred to.</p>

<p>"I have myself personally witnessed the condition of the
Chauci, both the Greater and the Lesser, situate in the regions of
the far north. In these climates a vast tract of land, invaded twice
each day and night by the overflowing waves of the ocean, opens
a question that is eternally proposed to us by Nature, whether
these regions are to be looked upon as belonging to the land, or
whether as forming a portion of the sea?</p>

<p>"Here a wretched race is found, inhabiting either the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
elevated spots of land, or else eminences artificially constructed,
and of a height to which they know by experience that the highest
tides will never reach. Here they pitch their cabins; and when the
waves cover the surrounding country far and wide, like so many
mariners on board ship are they; when, again, the tide recedes,
their condition is that of so many shipwrecked men, and around their
cottages they pursue the fishes as they make their escape with the
receding tide. It is not their lot, like the adjoining nations, to
keep any flocks for sustenance by their milk, nor even to maintain a
warfare with wild beasts, every shrub, even, being banished afar. With
the sedge and the rushes of the marsh they make cords, and with these
they weave the nets employed in the capture of the fish; they fashion
the mud, too, with their hands, and drying it by the help of the winds
more than of the sun, cook their food by its aid, and so warm their
entrails, frozen as they are by the northern blasts; their only drink,
too, is rainwater, which they collect in holes dug at the entrance
of their abodes; and yet these nations, if this very day they were
vanquished by the Roman people, would exclaim against being reduced to
slavery! Be it so, then&mdash;Fortune is most kind to many, just when
she means to punish them."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the preciseness of Pliny's description and the
fact that for several centuries, since the great sea-dykes were
erected, the scattered remains of these mounds have been accessible
on dry land, they have only quite recently attracted the attention
of archæologists. I consider their investigation important, not
only for the large amount of industrial remains they contain, but
for supplying a missing link in the evidence of continuity in the
European habit of constructing pile-dwellings.</p>

<h3>TERPEN (WEST FRIESLAND).</h3>

<p>Before the construction of the great sea-dykes in Holland nearly
the whole of West Friesland would have been in that hybrid condition
described by Pliny in which it was difficult to say whether it
belonged to sea or land (<i>dubiumque terræ sit, an pars maris</i>). At
the present time, however, these lands are richly cultivated and look
as if they were a dead level. It is only on close inspection that the
monotony is relieved by certain elevations of considerable extent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
called <i>Terpen</i>, whose summits rise to about the level of the larger
dykes. These mounds are situated at more or less regular intervals, so
that if the tides by any calamity had free scope, they would appear as
so many islands scattered over the country. It is on such elevations
that modern churches and villages are generally built, and, till
they accidentally attracted the attention of agriculturists, nobody
seemed to think anything about their origin. A few years ago it was
discovered that their interior was composed of a rich ammoniacal
deposit which agriculturists found valuable as a fertilising agent
when spread over their fields. The excavation of this substance for
manuring purposes now forms an important industry, and any landed
proprietor who happens to own a workable <i>terp</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> one
free of buildings&mdash;is on the way to realise a small fortune. When a
<i>terp</i> is found suitable for being excavated they generally commence
by digging a canal close up to its base, sufficiently large to admit
of the passage of good-sized boats. The boats are then easily loaded
with the stuff and so it is conveyed to all parts of the country. As
the workings advance the canal is also advanced, so that the boats
are always in close proximity to the diggings. In the course of these
operations, bones and horns of various animals, pottery, and other
relics of human industry, were occasionally turned up.</p>

<p>By degrees these repeated discoveries attracted the attention of
antiquaries, and Dr. Pleyte, of Leyden, is now publishing a large
illustrated work on the antiquities of Holland (B. 301), in which a
conspicuous place is given to the terp-mounds and their contents.
It is, however, to some of the office-bearers of the Museum of the
Friesch Genootschap at Leeuwarden, more especially Mr. Corbelijn
Battaerd, its conservator, that I am indebted for much of my
information on the subject. In this museum are stored up most of
the objects hitherto found in the terp-mounds, and the collection,
already unique of its kind, is daily and rapidly increasing, as orders
have been issued in regard to many of them that no relics are to
be disposed of without being, in the first place, submitted to the
authorities of the museum.</p>

<p>Like most countries, the early traditions of Holland have been
forgotten or ignored, and in its annals little mention is made of the
<i>terpen</i>. In explanation of the origin and early use of the word,
Dr. Pleyte quotes from Ocko van Scharl a passage to the effect that one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
the ancient kings of Friesland, named Adgillus, who reigned towards
the end of the sixth century, had caused, on account of the ravages
of an inundation which took place four years prior to his accession,
a large number of elevated places to be formed, so as to give shelter
to man and beast in the event of a recurrence of this danger. These
mounds were then called <i>Terpen</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Dirks, president of the Friesch Genootschap, as early as 1871
characterised these mounds as analogous to the terramara beds
of North Italy ("<i>ce sont des terramares historiques</i>");<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
but it remained to Professor Pigorini of Rome to show that they were
identical as regards internal structure. This he did in 1881 (B.
372c), after a visit to one at Aalzum which was then being excavated,
when he showed that there was a circumscribing dyke, and, although no
actual piles were then visible, he was informed by the proprietors
that such wooden structures had been occasionally met with. Prior to
his visit, it appears that no special attention was directed to these
structural remains. From all he could learn, however, on this point,
and especially from a consideration of the stratified arrangements
of the <i>débris</i>, Pigorini concluded that the deposits were due to
pile-dwellings, and had accumulated under precisely similar conditions
to the terremare, in regard to which he is such a distinguished authority.</p>

<p>The <i>terp</i> at Aalzum is still being systematically excavated,
and, though only as yet partially cleared off, its results, from an
archæological point of view, are now second to none of the kind in
Holland. Moreover, the excavations are conducted on an extensive
scale, and the locality is readily accessible. I can, therefore,
conceive of no better means of conveying to you some knowledge of the
nature and structural phenomena of these remarkable deposits, than by
detailing the facts which came under my own cognisance during a visit
I made this summer to the same spot under the guidance of my excellent
friend, Mr. Battaerd.</p>

<p>The <i>terp</i> lies about a mile to the north of the town of Dokkum,
some twelve miles from Leeuwarden, and four or five from the
seashore. In approaching the locality from Dokkum there was little to
attract special notice beyond the usual Dutch scenery&mdash;canals,
rich meadows, herds of splendid cattle, and here and there some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
well-cultivated cornfields. In front of us a slight elevation could
be discerned, crowned by a small church in the midst of a clump of
trees, the surroundings of which were neatly hedged meadows and
cornfields. As we advanced towards this church, and within a few
hundred yards of it, we entered on a sloping road, as if raised on
a dyke, but on each side the land was perfectly flat and bearing
a splendid crop: here a field of magnificent beans, and there an
equally promising one of wheat. These fields, said Mr. Battaerd, were
formerly part of the <i>terp</i>-mound from which the fertilising stuff
has already been removed, but this road was left undisturbed, so that
we are now actually walking on a portion of its surface. By-and-by we
came in sight of heaps of clayey stuff, the tops of which sparkled
with reflected light, and in their midst were to be seen the masts
and rigging of three boats. Those whitish clay-like heaps, said Mr.
Battaerd, formed the surface soil, which, being of no commercial
value, had to be wheeled off before the saleable deposits could
be got at. At last the actual workings were reached, and we found
ourselves in front of a perpendicular section some 15 or 18 feet high,
from which men and women were busily engaged in loading the boats.
Uppermost in my thoughts was the paramount question of the existence
of upright piles, which, it will be remembered, Pigorini had not
actually seen. Great was my delight when, at the very first glance,
my eye detected an undoubted pile of oak just in face of the cutting.
Close by it I soon found another and as we moved along numbers were
observed, some soft and yielding, scarcely offering any resistance
to the spade; and others of oak very hard in the centre, but more
decayed and ragged-like than those I have been in the habit of seeing
among the lake-dwelling remains. Those seen in this section differed
considerably in size; and I observed that some penetrated deeper
than others. At a little distance lay a heap of oak beams which had
recently been removed from the trenches&mdash;one of which I measured
and found it to be four yards in length, and from six to eight inches
thick. Upon inquiry, I ascertained that these beams lay horizontally,
and about half way down, in the stratified stuff.</p>

<p>Those who, like Professor Pigorini, are acquainted with the
structural features of the terremare of Northern Italy, will not be
surprised at the comparative rarity with which piles are met with
in the <i>terpen</i>, because of the rapidity with which timbers,
when buried in dry earth, decay and disappear altogether, leaving in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
many instances no traces whatever behind them. This fact was
strikingly shown by Chierici, who produced positive evidence of
the former existence of piles in the upper strata of some of the
terremare, by showing that the holes left by the piles, after
the woody fibre had completely disappeared by decomposition, had
become subsequently filled up by dust and infiltrated material,
which ultimately became hardened, and so retained the actual form
of the original piles. (<a href="#Page_248">See page 248</a>.) In short,
natural casts of the original piles were accidentally formed, which thus
disclosed a knowledge of their former existence, which otherwise might never
have been suspected. To the soundness of this deduction I have myself
unconsciously contributed by an observation which I made some years
ago, while digging at the crannog of Lochspouts, and having recorded
it I may perhaps be allowed here to repeat my words. "One day I was
greatly puzzled by finding what was evidently a portion of a birch
tree, from 6 to 9 inches in diameter, quite flat, and with scarcely
any wood left inside the thick bark. In no instance previously had
I seen the evidence of pressure on logs of this size; but after
carefully considering the point it was ascertained that such effects
occurred only in the upper portion of the mound, and above the log
pavement, where the wood had been exposed to atmospheric influences,
so that when the woody fibres rotted away the flattening of the
bark was easily produced. All the logs found buried in water or mud
retained their original dimensions and showed no trace of having
yielded to superincumbent pressure."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The absence of piles and wooden structures from many of these
mounds is, therefore, no proof that they have not formerly existed;
and, indeed, it is difficult to account for the horizontality and
regularity of the beds on any other hypothesis.</p>

<p>While I wandered about amidst the various sections presented by the
progressive stages of the excavations, wondering at the distinctness
of the strata, or picking up stray objects from the <i>débris</i>, such
as mussel shells, bits of bone, fragments of pottery, etc., which
were to be found here and there sticking in the face of the cuttings,
my friend, Mr. Battaerd, was deeply occupied in examining a heap of
bones, which lay weathering in a sunny corner. Having joined him in
his osteological study, I found that the chief point of attraction was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the head of a urus (<i>Bos primigenius</i>) of great size, and with
splendid horn cores&mdash;the finest example, according to Mr.
Battaerd, that had yet found its way to the museum.</p>

<p>The land close to the brink of the section, and extending over
a considerable portion of the mound, was occupied by growing corn,
and hence its dimensions can only be approximately stated. The
proprietors, Messrs. W. and J. Bierma, obligingly accompanied us,
and one of them assured me it could not be less than from three
to four hundred yards in diameter. Its greatest height above the
water in the canal was 18 feet, but of course the level of the
canal water is considerably lower than that of high tide in the
open sea. The commercially valuable stuff commenced some 3 or
4 feet below the surface, and continued without interruption to
within a few feet of the canal water. It was in this intermediate
portion that the relics were found: but their exact position,
especially that of the smaller objects, was seldom determined,
as it was generally after the stuff had become partially broken
up during transport that they were found.</p>

<p>The stuff <i>in situ</i> was distinctly stratified, forming layers of
various thicknesses, from a finger breadth up to 3 or 4 inches, or
sometimes more, which in some instances could be continuously traced
for long distances. Sometimes they shelved out altogether, and others
commenced. Here, a bed of fibrinous matter, in which quantities of the
partly decomposed fibres of flax could be readily recognisable; there,
a thickish deposit of a brownish glutinous stuff like peat. Charcoal
and ashes permeated the whole, and showed themselves sometimes as
distinct layers. Clay and sand were also largely mixed with these
deposits, and occasionally assumed the form of distinct and separate beds.</p>

<p>Having so far satisfied ourselves as to the structural arrangements
of the mound, and the disposition of its contents, we walked up to the
church, which is but a short distance from the workings. This small
edifice is surrounded by a burying ground, and among the gravestones
are some ancient-looking ones. Mr. Battaerd informed me that it dates
as far back as the eleventh century.</p>

<p>It is calculated that there are altogether about 150 of these
mounds in West Friesland alone, and that of these about the
half have been more or less examined, some being now entirely
cleared away. They are also to be found in the province of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Gröningen and some other parts of Holland. Dr. Dirks states
that the town of Leeuwarden is built over two terp-mounds;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
and Dr. Pleyte informed me that he has reason to believe that
the town of Leyden also reposes on similar deposits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relics</span> (<b><a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a></b>).&mdash;The
relics of human industry collected from the <i>terpen</i> are very varied
and numerous. Of these the following notes and illustrations, taken
chiefly from the large assortment in the Leeuwarden Museum, will serve
to convey some general idea of the social economy which prevailed
among the occupiers of these singular settlements, as well as of the
period in which they flourished.</p>

<p><i>Prehistoric.</i>&mdash;The prehistoric remains, commonly so-called,
such as cutting implements of stone, are only feebly represented, but
occasionally they do turn up, in which respect the <i>terpen</i> resemble
the Scottish and Irish crannogs.</p>

<p><i>Clay Objects.</i>&mdash;Perforated loom-weights, both conical
and flat; spindle-whorls in great numbers, and often ornamented
with finger marks or grooved lines (Nos. 2 and 3). Some flat and
triangularly-shaped objects of clay (No. 22) are perforated with
three holes, one at each angle, which are sometimes perpendicular
and sometimes parallel to the surface; in bulk and composition they
correspond with the loom-weights.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Pottery is, as a rule, coarse but abundant, and
represents vessels of various shapes and sizes, generally with ears,
but a few with handles (Nos. 20 and 23). Samian ware is represented by
many fragments of bowls and dishes. A few vases, apparently home-made,
have some traces of coloured patches; and there are lids with raised
handles and ornamented with hollowed dots.</p>

<p><i>Bone and Horn.</i>&mdash;Bone and horn implements are very abundant,
consisting of combs (Nos. 1 and 16 to 19) of varied forms, and
constructed of plates riveted together with iron rivets, and ornamented
with consecutive circles, lines, dots, and curvilinear figures;
among them are also a few combs with very long teeth (No. 30).<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
There are also pins (Nos. 26 and 28), needles (No. 29), buttons
(No. 25), dice (No. 21), finger rings (No. 12), knife handles, pointers,
etc. (Nos. 10, 11, 13 and 27). Many so-called skates made from the
long bone of the horse's leg. Two or three short bones (foot of the
ox) are covered with concentric circles, apparently for ornamentation.
A curious bone object (No. 7) is supposed to have been used in making twine or ropes.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
<i>Glass.</i>&mdash;Beads, blue, green and variegated; also glass slag.</p>

<p><i>Metal Objects.</i>&mdash;A few bronze dishes (No. 5), one a tripod
with projecting handle (No. 15). Figurines of men and animals; the
hand of a Roman statue, apparently a female and about full size; Roman
fibulæ; some three or four double spirals; a small pair of shears (No.
8), and a few bracelets with clasping-hooks. All these are of bronze.
Among objects of iron are shears, hammers, bridle-bits
(<b><a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a></b>), slag, etc. A leaden bar or pig weighing
17 kilogrammes and marked with three crosses, so, "<b>XXX</b>", was
found at Achlum.</p>

<p><i>Coins.</i>&mdash;Anglo-Saxon coins very abundant: at Hallum 180
<i>sceattæ</i> were found in a jar; Byzantine money in gold; Roman imperial
money, generally in silver, but sometimes in gold; Frankish coins. The
proprietors of Aalzum found a few silver coins in this terp with the
following inscription: "+ HLOTHARIVS. IMP. DORE STATVS MON (<i>eta</i>),"
which defines their date to be between 840 and 855 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

Iron Bridle-bit, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Wooden Objects.</i>&mdash;Small spades precisely similar to those
used by children while amusing themselves by digging the sand on the
seashore. Numbers of large casks the staves of which are kept together
by three iron hoops. In diameter these casks are not more than an
ordinary herring barrel, but in length they are from six to seven
feet, and about one-third from the top there is a small square hole 4
or 5 inches in diameter. The ends of the staves at the top rim of some
are much decayed, but the rest is perfectly sound, and for this reason
they are supposed to have stood in water with only the upper parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
exposed. They have been found in almost all the <i>terpen</i> examined,
usually at regular distances, and deeply buried. One, 6 feet high, was
found resting inside a vat 3 feet deep, and its highest point was over
two yards below the surface of the mound. Canoes and small paddles may
also be mentioned as occasional relics.</p>

<p><i>Nondescript Objects.</i>&mdash;Cock spurs; egg-shells of the domestic
fowl and goose, some of which, singularly enough, were, when found,
still unbroken; shells of various kinds of sea-urchins, star-fishes,
and mussels; amber beads, also this material in the unworked form;
amorphous vivianite; large quantities of the <i>débris</i> of flax; one
curious object is a flute made of the shank bone of a small animal;
one small fictile dish has four feet, and a few others are in the form
of three cups attached. At Aalzum, on the occasion of my visit, among
the articles purchased by Mr. Battaerd were a mitten and some sort of
head-dress like a felt wide-awake. The mitten had only one stall, for
the thumb.</p>

<p>In the <i>terp</i> called Beetgum there was found an urn, like those
from the dolmens of the Drenthe, containing some burnt bones. Human
bones are sometimes found, but they are supposed to have belonged to
secondary burials. At Aalzum a grave was found containing a body and
along with it was a fibula of the Merovingian period, with a flat
back containing a beautiful mosaic pattern of variegated glass and amber.</p>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;Osseous remains representing the following
animals:&mdash;Horse, ox (several varieties&mdash;<i>Bos taurus</i>,
<i>primgenius</i>, <i>longifrons</i>, <i>brevicornis</i>), cat, dog, sheep,
wild boar, deer, roe, and fallow deer. Among the skulls of these animals
(of which there are many) are one or two of the four-horned sheep. It
may be of interest to note that the osseous remains of this animal
were among those identified by Sir W. R. Wilde as coming from the
crannog of Lagore (<a href="#Page_351">page 351</a>).</p>

<h3>WARFEN (EAST FRIESLAND).</h3>

<p>In 1879 Dr. Tergast, of Emden, published a short account of
the prehistoric antiquities of East Friesland,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
in which he takes notice of the existence of certain mounds, in the
low-lying regions, called "Warfen," which he believes to be the
remains of very ancient settlements constructed for the protection
of their inhabitants against floods and the fluctuations of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
surrounding waters. The author does not give many details about these
mounds. It would appear, however, that they are to be met with in
considerable numbers, as he suggests that it would be of the highest
interest to archæological science to have a map constructed showing
their local distribution. Nor do they appear to have been subjected
to much practical investigation, as only three objects from them
are illustrated in Dr. Tergasts book. These are a bone implement
(so-called skate or cloth-polisher), a necklace of glass and amber
beads, and an iron arrow-point. He also figures a comb (six inches
long) similar to that from the <i>terpen</i> (<b><a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a></b>, No. 30),
but without specifying the locality where it was found. All these are
precisely similar to objects found in the terp-mounds of Holland.
Every indication, therefore, points to the conclusion that the
<i>Terpen</i> and <i>Warfen</i> are quite analogous to each other
and belong to the same period of time.</p>

<h3>WURTHEN (DITHMARSCHEN).</h3>

<p>In 1883, Dr. Hartmann, of Marne (B. 397), gave a more detailed
account of similar dwellings in the Holstein fen district, near the
embouchure of the river Elbe. These, in the form of low mounds, are
met with, according to him, in all the marshes along this part of the
North Sea coast. In the Dithmarschen, both north and south, they are
very numerous, and the larger ones, like the terp-mounds of Holland,
are now generally occupied by one or more modern buildings. In extent
they vary from 1&frac14; to 15 acres, and in height from 13 to 23
feet above ordinary mean tides. On several occasions in recent times,
in the course of excavating the foundations of new buildings, the
digging of wells, etc., various relics, such as fragments of pottery,
clay weights, iron implements, bits of manipulated staghorns, broken
bones, etc., were turned out, which, however, suggested nothing more
than passing comments. But their real nature is now clearly pourtrayed
by the facts recorded by Dr. Hartmann, the chief of which were
ascertained from excavations conducted by himself in the Fahrstedter
Wurth situated some three miles to the north of the Elbe. This
<i>Wurth</i>, some years ago, became the property of a brick manufacturer,
of the name of Huesmann, who was in the habit, from time to time, of
utilising its contents, partly for filling up old clay-pits and partly for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
manuring purposes. Such was the condition of the Fahrstedter Wurth
when Dr. Hartmann's attention was directed to it in August, 1881.
On his first visit, while poking about the open trenches, he picked
up, at a depth of four feet from the surface, a perforated clay
weight, four inches in diameter, and two and a half inches thick.
After this he continued his visits to the locality regularly, and,
in a short time, collected a number of relics, besides determining
many interesting points in regard to the structure of the mound. The
greatest depth reached by the haphazard excavations of Mr. Huesmann
was nine and a half feet. Along the exposed section down to this point
Dr. Hartmann distinguished the following layers:</p>

</table>

<p>This <i>Packwerk</i> is described as made up of decomposed branches,
from the size of a finger to, occasionally, the thickness of an
arm, arranged horizontally, but sometimes perpendicularly. Its
lower portion was composed of large quantities of the twigs of
birch and oak, the fibres of several marsh plants, broken bones,
and other organic <i>débris</i>. In the underlying clay he noticed some
holes, which he concluded to have been due to small piles, the
wood of which had disappeared by decomposition. Scattered through
this Packwerk were found, besides charcoal and ashes, a varied
assortment of the relics of human industry, of which the following
may be noted:&mdash;Fragments of pottery, (grey and black), among
which were some with perforations round the rims; sharpening-stones;
a perforated clay weight; twelve portions of quern stones, made
of basalt, and having a thickness of one and a half to two and
a half inches&mdash;from a fragment, the entire diameter of one
was ascertained to be 17 inches; several iron knives, a socketed
lance-head, and some nails, together with lumps of both iron and glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
slag. A wooden handle, some worked objects of bone with marks of
rivets, bits of birch-bark, etc. A black mass of asphalt, supposed
to be a product of birch-bark, had embedded in it the shell of a
hazel-nut. From this it was inferred that the mass was originally
in a fluid condition.</p>

<p>Among the osseous remains the following animals were identified
by Dr. Pfeffer, of the Natural History Museum at Hamburg, and Dr.
Rautenburg:&mdash;dog, ox, pig, sheep, stag, horse, bittern (?), and
sturgeon (recognised by its scales).</p>

<p>In the clay below the Packwerk (<i>Kleierde</i>) were found the
stumps of eight piles, five to six feet apart, which Dr. Hartmann
concluded had originally passed upwards through the fascine
work, but now only the portions embedded in the clay remained,
the rest having disappeared by decomposition. Of these piles (four
oak, three birch, and one ash), some were round and some rectangular,
and nearly all more or less pointed at the lower extremity.
The exceptions were blunt and rested on some fragments of
granite stones. One of the piles, which measured six inches broad,
and two and three-quarter inches thick, contained four round
holes, in one of which a portion of a spar still remained.</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself as to the condition of this portion
of the mound already exposed, Dr. Hartmann got permission from
the proprietor to sink a shaft into the undisturbed portion underneath.
The superficial area of this shaft was 12 feet long and 9
broad, and it was excavated until the sea-sand was reached, at a
depth of 11&frac12; feet&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> about 21 feet from the
surface of the mound.</p>

<p>Continuing now our inspection of this section (the upper
portion of which I have already detailed) the following layers
were successively passed through:&mdash;</p>

The two <i>Packwerke</i> here encountered are stated to be similar to the
first, and the relics are also much of the same character. The under
portion of both is described as being made up of twigs of oak, birch,
and hazel, very much birch-bark, worked bits of wood, wooden handles
of tools, burnt faggots, <i>débris</i> of marsh plants (<i>Schilf</i>, <i>Binsen</i>,
<i>und Samen von Polygonum</i>), small bundles of bast and other fibres of
fine roots, shells of hazel-nuts, fragments of pottery (six pounds),
lumps of iron slag (five pounds), broken bones (sixteen pounds),
charcoal, a piece of redstone, and the shells of some edible molluscs
(<i>Helix fruticum</i> and <i>Strigella</i>, and <i>Cardium edule</i>).</p>

<p>Among the relics to be noted are a spindle-whorl, an iron buckle,
and a bit of leather.</p>

<p>Of special interest is a third series of piles, which he describes
as terminating in the sea-sand underneath all. These piles were five
in number, four oak and one birch, 2 to 5&frac12; inches in thickness,
and 18 to 33 inches in length. They were placed in a zig-zag
fashion about 1&frac12; foot apart, and traced through the layer of
"Kuhdünger" to the "Packwerk," where they became so rotten as to be no
longer recognised. One of them had also a hole, which still retained
portion of a projecting spar.</p>

<p>Our investigator made observations, but of a much more limited
character, on nine other <i>Wurthen</i>, and in all of them he found
the "Packwerk" to be a special feature in their structure.</p>

<p>Such is an epitome of the facts on which Dr. Hartmann bases his
opinion that not only the <i>Wurthen</i>, but also the neighbouring
<i>Warfen</i> and <i>Terpen</i>, were constructed like the fascine islands
of prehistoric Switzerland, and the Scottish and Irish crannogs. The
idea of pile-buildings can scarcely be entertained by him, and he
stoutly combats Pigorini's opinions in regard to the <i>Terpen</i>
of West Friesland.</p>

<p>The Fahrstedter Wurth, according to Hartmann, consisted of an
original mound some seven feet high, to which on two subsequent
occasions additions were made. The initiatory process of its
construction was to form a basis of <i>Kuhdünger</i> two feet in thickness.
Over this clay and rubbish were placed, to the extent of other two
feet; and then came the fascine structures, which raised the mound
other three feet. To keep the mass together, piles were driven here
and there down to the sandy bottom. But the inhabitants soon found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
that this was too low to shelter them from the waves and floods, so
they constructed an addition to their mound, which raised its surface
to ten feet. But this was not enough, and so a third addition was
made, which added six feet more to the mound. At this height its
surface would be about twenty feet above the medium sea level (<i>Normal
Null</i>), and at this height Dr. Hartmann concludes that cottages
would be quite secure, as the highest tides on record&mdash;viz.
4th February, 1825, reached only 12 feet 4 inches above the medium
sea level, a result which would leave a considerable margin for the
Fahrstedter Wurth. Of course, the tides never reach it now, as it is
protected by the sea-dykes, the first of which was constructed in the
middle of the twelfth century.</p>

<p>Very little reflection shows the inherent improbability of Dr.
Hartmann's theory. Where could the primitive builders get such
a quantity of "Kuhdünger" to start with? If the "Packwerk" was
constructed as a solid mass, how could its under portions be so
prolific of such varied relics, and other odds and ends of human
occupancy? Moreover, the disproportion between the original and final
height of the mound is incompatible with the supposition that the
successive increases were merely additions entailed by unforeseen
circumstances, such as an unusual storm. The three platforms with
their corresponding series of upright piles, the stratified assortment
of the structural materials, and the position of the relics and
<i>débris</i> of its inhabitants scattered throughout the entire mound,
are, in my opinion, inexplicable on any other hypothesis than that
we have here the remains of pile-dwellings, successively erected one
above the other, precisely similar to the terremare already described.
The more probable <i>modus operandi</i> was to construct in the first
place a circumscribing dyke of mud, varying in size according to the
number of the tribe or family, behind which the cottages were built
on platforms supported on piles. When the under spaces became filled
up with the accumulated <i>débris</i> of men and cattle, and all the other
odds and ends of continued occupancy, the process was repeated again
and again, until the whole enclosed area, in the course of some
centuries, became a flattish mound or island within the limits of the tidal shore.

<h2>Fifth Lecture.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE LAKE-DWELLINGS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.</span></h2>

<h3>I.&mdash;IRISH CRANNOGS.</h3>

<p>Public attention was first directed to Irish crannogs by Sir W.
Wilde, in the year 1839. It appears that early in this year Dr.
Petrie's curiosity was roused by the frequency of the visits of a
local dealer offering for sale objects of more or less archæological
value, which, he stated, were found in a peat bog at Dunshaughlin, in
the county of Meath. The articles exhibited were of a miscellaneous
character, and their assortment in such a place seemed so strange
that Dr. Petrie determined to visit the locality. Accordingly he and
Surgeon Wilde (afterwards Sir W. R. Wilde) started for West Meath in
search of the mysterious find, and were conducted to the peat-bog of
Lagore, near the village of Dunshaughlin. Here, within the boundaries
of a drained lake, they found an artificial mound entirely overgrown
with peat, then partially exposed by turf-cutters. On making inquiries
as to the antecedents of this mound they were informed that it had
been well known to bone-collectors for upwards of ten years, and
that already 150 cart-loads of bones had been dug out and forwarded
to Scotland for manure. Altogether the find was considered of great
importance, and it was arranged between the two antiquaries that
Petrie should write a description of the antiquities, while Wilde was
to confine himself to an analysis of the animal remains.</p>

<p>According to Mr. W. F. Wakeman,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
it appears that Dr. Petrie was a little jealous of Surgeon Wilde's
enthusiasm for archæology, and accordingly wished to limit the scope
of his investigations. Wilde's paper, entitled "On the Animal Remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
and Antiquities recently found at Dunshaughlin," was read at a meeting
of the Irish Academy on the 27th April, 1840, and it is singular, and
perhaps confirmatory of Wakeman's suggestion, that, with the exception
of two extracts bearing on the situation and structure of the mound,
it is reported in the Proceedings only in abstract. I here quote these
extracts as the most authoritative description of this remarkable
lake-dwelling now extant:&mdash;</p>

<h4>LAGORE OR DUNSHAUGHLIN.</h4>

<p>"About a mile to the east of the village of Dunshaughlin, on the
townland of <i>Lagore</i>, and near the margin of a 'cutaway' black bog,
is a circular mound, slightly raised above the surrounding plain, its
highest central part being about eight feet above the margin, and the
circumference of the mound measuring 520 feet. A small stream passes
through the circle; and the whole bog in which it is situated occupies
a slight concavity of about a mile and a half in circumference,
bounded by raised tillage and pasture lands. Within the memory of some
of the old inhabitants of the neighbourhood, this bog was covered with
water during the greater part of the year, and it is so invariably
during winter up to the present period. A large pond is still in
existence in one of the fields adjoining the mound. A few years ago
some labourers, while clearing the stream-way, discovered several
bones protruding from its sides; and in May, 1839, the quantity of
bones found in the drain was so great, and their value so well known,
that a further examination was made, when it was discovered that the
greater part of the mound was composed of the remains of animals,
placed there in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The circumference of the circle was formed by upright posts of
black oak, measuring from 6 to 8 feet in height; these were mortised
into beams of a similar material, laid flat upon the marl and sand
beneath the bog, and nearly 16 feet below the present surface. The
upright posts were held together by connecting cross-beams, and
fastened by large iron nails; parts of a second upper tier of posts
were likewise found, resting on the lower ones. The space thus
enclosed was divided into separate compartments, by septa or divisions
that intersected one another in different directions; these were also
formed of oaken beams in a state of great preservation, but joined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
together with greater accuracy than the former, and in some cases
having their sides grooved or rabbited to admit large panels driven
down between them. The interiors of the chambers so formed were filled
with bones and black moory earth, and the heap of bones was raised up
in some places within a foot of the surface. It was generally found
that the remains of each species of animal were placed in separate
divisions, with but little intermixture with any other; and the
antiquities, etc., were found along with them, without any order or
regularity, but for the most part near the bottom." (B. 4, p. 420.)</p>

<p>From the abstract of Wilde's paper I find that among the osseous
remains the following animals were represented:&mdash;several
varieties of oxen, the pig (a smaller variety than is now bred in
Ireland), the horse, the ass, the common and fallow deer, the goat,
<i>one skull of the four-horned sheep</i>, a large species of the greyhound
tribe, probably the Irish wolf-dog, and the fox. A few bones of
birds, the shells of limpets and buccinums, and a large quantity of
the broken shells of hazel-nuts were also noted. Nearly in the centre
of the heap, and within 2 feet of the surface, were found two human
skeletons lying at length, and without any surrounding wood or stone
coffin. Owing to the prejudices of the peasants these bones had to be
re-interred. The report then goes on to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The antiquities found in this place may be divided into the
warlike, the culinary, and the ornamental. They consisted of <i>iron</i>
swords of different lengths, with straight edges and angular points,
and bearing a resemblance to the ancient Roman swords. Very many
knives were found, of different shapes and sizes, with iron spear,
javelin, and dagger blades, and part of the boss or central ornament
of a shield; but <i>no brazen weapons</i> of any description. Two querns,
or ancient corn-mills, were found on the marl, at the bottom of the
enclosure; sharpening-stones, iron chains, an iron axe, a brazen pot,
and three small brass bowls of most elegant shape and workmanship;
several articles precisely resembling miniature frying-pans, of about
three inches in diameter (perhaps incense-burners); circular discs of
turned bone, wood, and slate, like those supposed to have been used at
the end of the distaff; small shears, like the modern sheep-shears;
brazen, bone, and iron pins, from 4 to 6 inches in length, the former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
of great beauty of construction; brooches, and parts of buckles,
containing pieces of enamel and mosaic work; bracelets; wooden
(yew-tree) combs, toothpicks, etwees, and other articles belonging to
the toilet. Several of these articles show an extraordinary state of
perfection of the arts at the period of their construction.</p>

Carved Bone, showing some of the designs real size.</p>
</div>

<p>"A very curious bone was likewise found (<b><a href="#Fig_102">Fig. 102</a></b>),
and exhibited to the meeting, with a number of devices carved on it,
as if by way of practice in engraving; these devices consisted of
scrolls and marks precisely similar to those found on ancient Irish
crosses, ornaments, and gravestones. There were no crosses, beads, or
<i>Christian</i> sacred ornaments found in the excavation: but a number of
pieces of stags' horns sawn across, and also pieces of hazel-wood,
in great quantity, as if laid up for firewood, were found in one
spot near the bottom. Some of the articles exhibited now belong to
the collection of the Dean of St. Patrick's: but the greater number
were forwarded for the inspection of the Academy by Mr. Barnwall, of
Grennanstown, on whose ground the discovery was made, and to whom
Mr. Wilde was indebted for the bones, and permission to make any
researches he might require."</p>

<p>The late Lord Talbot de Malahide, writing in the <i>Archæological
Journal</i> of June, 1849 (B. 10, p. 101), says, in regard to the
Lagore find:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A great portion of these valuable relics became the property of
the late Dr. Dawson, Dean of St. Patrick's; and on his decease were
purchased, with the rest of his Irish antiquities, and presented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
to the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy. Surgeon Wilde also presented
to the same institution a valuable collection of the bones found
in the same locality. Mr. Barnwall, the owner of the soil, still
possesses some remnant of this treasure, after having been plundered
to a considerable extent by dishonest servants; and those specimens
which I possess, representations of some of which are given in
illustration of this paper, I owe to the liberality and kindness
of the same gentleman."</p>

<p><i>Objects of Iron.</i>&mdash;Two double-edged swords, one measuring 22&frac14; inches,
inclusive of the tang which passed through the hilt; the blade, 18&frac12; inches
long and 1&#8540; inch wide, was formed with a wide shallow groove along its
entire length. The other sword-blade measures 15&frac14; inches and is formed
with a central ridge. A blade, curved towards the point, in some degree
resembling certain Oriental weapons; the curved portion alone has a
cutting edge on both sides; length 13&frac14; inches, and width of curved
portion 1 inch. Two spear-heads, in fine preservation and very sharp;
length 10 inches. A peculiar single-edged weapon, resembling the glaive
of simplest form, but of diminutive size, the blade measuring only 8 inches.
An iron axe-head, length 7 inches. A peculiar iron pipe. (<a href="#Page_431">See page 431</a>.)

<p><i>Bronze.</i>&mdash;A small bowl 5&frac14; inches diameter, height 3
inches. Three armillæ of rude fashion. Portion of bronze ornament with
enamelled work and exquisite finish. Portion of a ring fibula, with
the extremities, between which the acus passed, dilated and flat.
There are cavities in the metal in which enamel or some other ornament
appears to have been incrusted. Portion of an object with interlaced
ornamentation (<b><a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a></b>), of unknown use. Several
bronze pins of various fashion and size, from 3 to 6 inches in length. Four of
these have movable rings appended to one extremity in lieu of a head.

representation here annexed, of the same size as the original
(<b><a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a></b>).</p>

<p><i>Bone.</i>&mdash;Two bone needles or bodkins, being perforated at the

<p>In April, 1887, through the courtesy and assistance of the present
Lord Talbot de Malahide, I had the satisfaction of inspecting most of
the above described objects, which are still in safe keeping among the
art treasures of Malahide Castle. Illustrations of most of them are
given on <b><a href="#Fig_103">Figs. 103</a></b> and <b><a href="#Fig_104">104</a></b>.</p>

<p>The objects from Lagore which went to the Museum of the Irish
Academy, together with those in the Petrie collection (now belonging
to the Academy), are in such a state of confusion, owing to the
absence of distinguishing labels, and the want of harmony between the
numbers on the objects and those in the official catalogue, that,
notwithstanding several visits to the museum with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
the express purpose of identifying and singling out some of the
crannog remains, I have been unable to make much addition to
those already illustrated.</p>

</div>

<p>By the kind permission of the council of the Royal Irish Academy
I am enabled to make use of the few woodcuts from Wilde's catalogue
illustrative of objects from Lagore. They are as follows:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
The top of a pin ornamented with three movable rings (<b><a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a></b>),
an ornamental bone comb, a bronze dagger, and three beads
(<b><a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a></b>). The ribbed bead is opaque, with traces
of a light green varnish, and is almost identical with beads found in the
Scottish crannogs. Another is an inch long and has a raised ornament
in white on a deep blue ground.</p>

<p>The objects represented on <b><a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a></b> I have identified,
with the assistance of Mr. Wakeman, as coming from the same remarkable
locality. They are all of iron and represented one-third natural size,
and will be readily recognised as tools and weapons of ordinary use.</p>

<p>In regard to the historic notices of Lagore Sir W. R. Wilde writes
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "As the earliest discovered and examined
crannoge in modern times has been that of Lagore, near Dunshaughlin,
County of Meath, so, upon looking into the authorities, we find it
the first alluded to. Loch Gabhair is said to have been one of the
nine lakes which burst forth in Ireland A.M. 3581 ('Annals of the Four
Masters'; see also Colgan's 'Acta Sanctorum,' p. 422, n. 14). In A.D.
848, we read that Cinaedh, son of Conaing, Lord of Cianachta-Breagh,
in Meath, went with a strong force of foreigners, and plundered the
Ui-Neill from the Sionainn (the Shannon) to the sea; 'and he plundered
the island of Loch Gabhor, and afterwards burned it, so that it was
level with the ground.' And in the old translation of the 'Annals of
Ulster,' Codex Clarendensis, the passage is thus rendered:&mdash;"And
brake down the island of Loch Gavar to the very bottom.' Again,
in A.D. 933, the same authority informs us that&mdash;'The island
of Loch-Gavar [was] pulled down by Aulaiv O'Hivair,' and the cave
of Knowth, on the Boyne, plundered during one of the Scandinavian
marauding expeditions with which the kingdom was then troubled. Thus
we have evidence that Lagore crannoge was occupied upwards of one
thousand years ago." (B. 18, p. 229.)</p>

<h4>DISCOVERY OF OTHER CRANNOGS.</h4>

<p>Sir W. Wilde states that a few months after the discovery of
Lagore, an island "artificially formed of timber and peat" was
brought to light upon lowering the water of Roughan Lake, near
Dungannon, on which "numerous fragments of ancient pottery and
bones, a few bronze spear-heads," and an upper ornamental quern
stone, were discovered. Other discoveries of a similar character
are successively noted as having been made in various other
localities. An island became exposed on the lowering of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
waters of Lough Gur, county of Limerick, from which it is said
a vast collection of bones and a great number of antiquities have
from time to time been obtained. Among the latter is a most
interesting stone mould (<b><a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a></b>)
for bronze spear-heads.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
In 1845, Mr. Shirley, in his "account of the kingdom of Farney" (B. 8,
p. 94), describes another crannog which was brought to light two years
previously, as constituting "The island Ever Mac Cooley's house." "The
foundations," writes Mr. Shirley, "of this ancient residence were
discovered in the autumn of 1843, seven feet below the present surface
of the earth, in the little island at Lisanisk, and two feet below
the present water level of the lake a double row of piles were found
sunk in the mud; they were formed of young trees, from 6 to 12 inches
in diameter, with the bark on. The area enclosed by these piles, from
which we may judge of the size of the house, was 60 feet in length by
42 feet in breadth." In the following year the same writer describes
two other lake-dwellings in the same district, one in Lake Monalty and
the other in Lough-na-Glack, on and around which the following relics
were said to have been found:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Three bronze celts with loops on the sides, and the remains of the
stick were found in one of them; a very perfect small dagger of
bronze, one foot in length; two bronze arrow-heads, double pointed;
a bronze gouge or chisel, rarely found in Ireland; the head of a
bronze hunting-spear; part of a bronze sword or dagger; a bronze cap,
apparently the end of a wooden hilt of some weapon; the bronze handle
of a javelin or spear, with loop attached; the boss of a shield of
bronze; a bronze knife which appears to have been gilt; a bronze knife
or dagger, measuring 10&frac12; inches in length; a smaller one 7 inches

in length; a
bronze bolt, with loop, measuring 16&frac12; inches in
length&mdash;this was found sticking in the mud, close to the island
on Lough-na-Glack; another, 12 inches in length, has been since found
in the island itself. Of bronze ornaments found on these islands there
are the following: Several bronze rings of different sizes, two of
them with transverse spring openings, others hollow, and probably
parts of armour or horse trappings; two bronze needles, one of them
with the eye entire; a bronze pin, the head hollowed like a cup, and
bearing a striking resemblance to the ends of the golden ornaments
often found in Ireland; several bronze pins like modern shirt pins;
parts of several bronze fibulæ or brooches, with fragments of several
bronze instruments, rivets, etc.; a small circular bronze bell, like
a sheep-bell; three harp keys of bronze of different sizes. Of other
ornaments found on the island on Lough-na-Glack I may particularly
mention several amber and blue glass beads, three bone pins, and
a comb apparently of ivory. Of iron instruments, an iron dagger,
measuring with the hilt 15 inches; several iron coulters of ploughs
of very primitive form, 7 inches in length; parts of iron instruments
the use of which it is impossible to determine; a long gun-barrel, 3
feet 8 inches in length, of that sort, I believe, formerly called a
calliver; part of the lock of a pistol; many large bullets of lead
were also found. I may add to this list a pair of quern stones, found
on the Monalty Island; some burnt corn; remains of coarse broken
earthenware vessels, and bits of thick dark glass; an earthen pot,
shaped like a hat; another of Dutch manufacture, with the figure of
a man's head below the spout, used in Ireland during the seventeenth
century, and called grey-beards; some small Dutch tobacco pipes; cut
oval stones, apparently intended for pounding in mortars; several
circular stones, with holes in the centres, often found with ancient
remains, and considered in Ireland to belong to the ancient spinning
wheels; also several stones, or hones, of different shapes and sizes,
for sharpening weapons and tools; a brass token, nearly defaced,
probably of the reign of Charles II." (B. 9, p. 44.)</p>

<p>In 1845, when the lake of Corcreevy, county of Tyrone, was
drained, its crannog was examined by Mr. Burnside, when the
following articles were recovered from among its remains:&mdash;A
pair of bronze and iron manacles, an ornamental comb of bone,
parts of a musical instrument, an arrow-head, a spear-head, and
a hammer-stone.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>

<h4>BALLINDERRY.</h4>

<p>About the same time the crannog in Ballinderry Lough, near Moate,
county of Meath, became known, and appears to have yielded a large
quantity of bones and antiquities, together with one or two canoes.
From the number of objects now in the Museum of the Royal Irish
Academy, and in private collections, said to be found on this crannog,
it must have been an unusually rich repository of lake-dwelling
relics; yet, singular to relate, Sir W. Wilde dismisses the subject by
stating that he was indebted to Mr. Hayes, of Moate, for a description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
of the find, together with a plan and map of the locality. On this
crannog Mr. Graves, writing as late as 1883, makes the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="blockquot">
"There was a great crannog in this lakelet, surrounded by a stockade
of oak piles. Around this and on the crannog was found an immense
quantity of the antlers of the red deer, and the bones of deer, oxen,
sheep, and other animals, which were sold as manure. A great and
varied mass of objects of an archæological nature were also found on,
in, and around the crannog, some of which found their way to the hands
of various collectors, and some, I believe, are in the Museum of the
Royal Irish Academy (<b><a href="#Fig_108">Figs. 108</a></b>
and <b><a href="#Fig_112">112</a></b>), but unhappily
no record or connected account of that great crannog or its finds has
been preserved. Amongst the articles of wood which Mr. Browne secured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
was a portion of an ancient harp. The pins and amulets exhibited on
the occasion referred to have since been engraved, and I now describe
them, beginning with the amulets (<b><a href="#Fig_109">Fig. 109</a></b>),
which are here engraved from photographs full size." (B. 391, p. 196.)</p>

It is suggested by Mr. Graves that the curious scorings on these
pins are of the nature of Ogham and Runic writing (<b><a href="#Fig_110">Figs. 110</a></b>
and <b><a href="#Fig_111">111</a></b>), but special authorities who have examined them
do not support this theory. Moreover, I doubt the genuineness of both
the pins and amulets.</p>

<h4>LOUGH FAUGHAN.</h4>

<p>Rev. Charles Archbold, writing of a crannog in Lough
Faughan, county Down, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"I found that the island was in a great measure, if not altogether,
artificial. There were large stakes driven into the ground, and
completely enclosing the space within, but not rising above the
surface, so as to form a palisade, but evidently for the purpose of
keeping in the soil from the encroachment of the water. The tradition
respecting it is, that there had been a castle on the shore opposite,
the chieftain of which caused this island to be made as a place of
refuge from the sudden onslaughts of the O'Neills; and to render this
retreat more secure he would never allow more than one boat or canoe
on the lake. During the drainage of the lake some years ago, a canoe
formed out of a solid piece of oak was found near the island." A jug
of excellent workmanship was found on this crannog (<b><a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a></b>).
(B. 18, p. 224.)</p>

<h4>DISCOVERIES BY BOARD OF WORKS.</h4>

<p>But the greatest discoveries were due to the workings of the
Commission for the Arterial Drainage and Inland Navigation of Ireland,
which brought no less than twenty-two additional crannogs to light
in the counties of Roscommon, Leitrim, Cavan, and Monaghan. Reports
of these crannogs by the engineers of the Board of Works, with
plans, maps, and sections of the more important (<b><a href="#Fig_114">Figs. 114</a></b>
and <b><a href="#Fig_115">115</a></b>), as well as the relics collected on them,
were given to the Royal Irish Academy. Unfortunately these relics are now
indiscriminately mixed with other Irish antiquities, and are virtually
beyond identification.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Mr. Mulvany, Commissioner of Public Works,
makes the following remarks on the general features of construction
of the crannogs encountered by them during these drainage operations
prior to the year 1852:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_114" id="Fig_114"></a>

  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 114</b>.&mdash;Section of
<span class="smcap">Ardakillen</span> Crannog, near Strokestown.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">

  <img src="images/i_404_b.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="414" />
  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 115</b>.&mdash;Plan of Crannog in
<span class="smcap">Drumaleague Lough</span>. Outer circle 60 feet in diameter.</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot">
"1. They are surrounded by stakes, driven generally in a circle from
60 to 80 feet in diameter; but in some cases the inclosure is larger,
and of an oval shape, as, for instance, that in Loughtown Lake, which
is 120 feet from east to west and 100 feet from north to south;
and one of those in Lough Mac Hugh, which measures 118 feet in one
direction and 74 feet in another.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"2. These outside stakes are generally of oak from 4 to 9
inches in diameter; sometimes driven in a single row, sometimes double, and in
some cases, as that of island No. 1 in Drumaleague Lake, the stakes
are found in a single row in parts of the island, and in double or
treble rows, or clusters, in other parts. The island in Loughtown
Lake differs from the others in being surrounded by a mass of stakes
upwards of 15 feet wide, and rather inclined towards the centre of the island.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"3. The portions of the stakes remaining in the ground
are evidently the lower ends of young trees, or of branches of large
trees, which were stuck down just as they grew in the wood; the
thicker end downwards, and bearing the marks of the hatchet by
which they were felled. A considerable length of these stakes must,
therefore, have projected over the ground; and they may probably have
been joined together by horizontal branches, interlaced so as to form
a screen, well calculated to serve for shelter or defence. All the
portions of the stakes which were above ground have been destroyed
by time; but the portions remaining below ground, particularly where
the stratum is pure peat, are generally very sound at heart, and have
become as black as the oak usually found in bogs.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"4. The surface within the staked inclosure is usually
covered over with a layer or two of round logs, cut into lengths of from
4 to 6 feet, over which are found more or less stones, clay, and gravel.
In some cases where the foundation is very soft, as in island No. 2 of
Drumaleague Lake, the layers of timber are very deep. In other cases,
where the ground is naturally firm, the platform of timber is confined
to a portion of the island.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"5. In almost every case a collection of flat stones has
been found near the centre of the inclosure, having marks of fire on them,
and apparently having served as a hearth. In the island No. 2 of
Drumaleague Lake there were three of these hearths found in different
parts of the enclosure.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"6. Considerable quantities of bones are generally found
upon or around the island, being apparently those of deer, black cattle, and
hogs; the skulls of the cows being long and narrow, with very short horns.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"7. In almost every case one or more pairs of quern
stones have been found within the enclosure.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"8. In many cases pieces of oak-framing have been found,
with mortices and cheeks cut in them. Some of these, such as what were
found on island No. 2 of Drumaleague, appear to have been portions of
an ordinary door-frame; but others, such as those found on the island
of Lough Scur and in Loughtown Lake, are portions of a heavy frame,
the use of which does not appear so evident." (B. 13, Ap., p. 44.)</p>

<h4>STROKESTOWN CRANNOGS.</h4>

<p>Adjacent to the ancient palace of the Kings of Connaught
are three lakes, viz. Cloonfree, Cloonfinlough, and Ardakillen, in
each of which one or two crannogs became exposed during the
drainage operations of the Board of Works.</p>

<p>The following antiquities found in the lake of Cloonfree
were presented to the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy, by
Alonzo Lawder, Esq. (B. 11<i>a</i>, p. 219):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
"A horseshoe, made of iron; a fragment of iron, probably the hilt of
a sword; an iron spike, for butt-end of a spear; a bone spear-head;
a bone pin; two amber beads; a bronze tweezer; ditto, broken, but
of different matter; a bronze pin with ornamented head, having a
cross and arrow-shaped device carved on two sides of it; a very long
bronze pin, with ornamented spike, head, and ring (a peculiarly fine
specimen); a small iron pin, with head bound with bronze wire, and
small circular disc pendant; a boar's tusk; and a buckle."</p>

<p>The crannog of Cloonfinlough was no less than 130 feet in
diameter, and is thus described by Mr. Dennis H. Kelly
(B. 11, p. 208):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "It is constructed on oak piles (many of them
showing the action of fire), driven into the soft marl at regular
distances, and tied together by horizontal stretchers, so as to form a
triple stockade round it, with an interval of about five feet between
each stockade. Outside of this, to the north-westward, are a number of
irregularly placed piles, stretching a short distance from the islet,
and it was adjoining to them the great deposit of bones was found. The
centre of these stockades was laid with trunks of smallish oak trees,
placed flat on the marl, and all pointing to a common centre, thus
forming a platform whereon the island itself was constructed. When
it was first observed, there was, jutting out from the island to the
lake, towards the west, a kind of jetty or pier, formed of a double
row of piles and stretchers running parallel, about 8 feet asunder,
and on which logs of timber were closely laid horizontally.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Of this gangway, and of the stockades, there are
now but very imperfect remains, so much has been broken up and removed
by the peasantry.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The deposit of bones, etc., close to this
island, consisted of bones of cattle, deer, horses, swine, sheep,
fowl, dogs, deer, both fallow and red, a few specimens (in general
much broken) of the horns of the Irish elk, and one or two specimens
of human remains, and amongst them a quantity of articles of a most
miscellaneous description, some of apparently very great antiquity,
and others of a much more recent date. Amongst these are spear-heads,
bronze pins, some of exquisite workmanship, and scarcely any two of
exactly the same form. A brass bowl, hammered out of the solid; two
brass vessels, made of small pieces most curiously riveted together; a
brooch of handsome workmanship; a variety of bone pins and implements;
deer-horn combs, of very great artistic merit; horn discs, like
backgammon men; knives, hooks, and hatchets of iron; swords and
spear-heads; an iron implement, like what a baker uses for putting his
loaves in the oven, made of sheet iron, curiously riveted together,
and having in the centre a circular ornament, with a cross in it, that
has evidently once had an arabesque pattern on it; sundry miniature
frying-pans, and a small whetstone; single and double bronze rings;
one coin of the Emperor Hadrian; one bulla, Pope Paul V.; sundry
silver coins, most of them Edwards, and one so late as James, 1690,
and one silver coin, unfigured in any collection that I have seen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Between the island and the ruined church were
found two canoes, hollowed out of single oak trees, but neither
of them much more than two feet wide; the stern of one of them
was perforated with numerous auger holes, about one inch each in
diameter.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"On examining the structure of the island itself,
which was effected by cutting a trench 20 feet long by 5 wide, as
near the centre as possible, there was found, at about eight inches
under the surface, which was covered with rank grass growing in a
rich mould, a very close-laid pavement of irregular-sized boulder
stones. When this was removed, a stratum of black earth was exposed,
with occasional fragments of bones through it of swine, fowl, sheep,
cattle, and deer; and about six inches beneath this, a considerable
layer of burned earth, with several inches of unburned clay under
it. Then came a second very closely-laid pavement of large-sized,
flat-surfaced stones, beneath which were alternate layers of black
earth and burned clay and marl, reaching down to the log platform,
and interspersed, like the one above it, with occasional bones and
fragments of bones; some few human remains, viz. one skull, and
portions of some more were got on the exterior edge. No coffin-stone,
chest, or other sepulchral remains.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Amongst these relics are knives, <i>some of
which have failed in the forging</i>; combs in an incomplete state of
manufacture, deer-horns sawn in sunder, and shavings as if <i>left after
a turner</i>. From these I am led to think that, whatever may have been
its original occupants, in later times the little island resounded
to the busy hum of industry, and that the smith, the brazier, the
comb-maker, and the turner, there drove a brisk trade, and sometimes
solaced their leisure in the construction of pretty toys, like
the tiny plate-bucket in the possession of the post-mistress of
Strokestown, and whose neatness of finish would do no discredit to
our best modern cabinet-makers. It is turned in oak, and hooped with
brass, four and a half inches high, and four inches diameter. There
was originally a pair, but one was unfortunately broken."</p>

<p>From Cloonfinlough only the following relics went to the
Museum of the Irish Academy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Small brass bowl (probably <b><a href="#Fig_116">Fig. 116</a></b>), iron bill-hook,
long iron spear-head, iron shears, large tooth, portion of a hone stone,

bronze pin with perforated head, small bronze pin and piece of thick
wire, bone needle and pin." (<i>Proc. R. I. A.</i>, vol. v., Ap., p. 61.)</p>

<p>A considerable collection from the same place has, however, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
found a safe resting place in the British Museum, of which the more

<p>In regard to the Ardakillen crannog Mr. Kelly writes:&mdash;"Near
this was found a boat 40 feet in length and 4 feet across the bow,
hollowed out of a single oak; and in which were a skull, a bronze pin,
and a spear, which, by the liberality of Mr. R. Kelly, I am permitted
to present to the Academy. The skull is perforated in the forehead,
and has the mark of no less than twenty sword-cuts on it, showing the
murderous conflict in which its owner must have been engaged; and
near to it were found a neck-piece of iron and 20 feet of rude chain
attached, that would do credit to the dungeons of Naples, and by which
its unhappy victim was made fast." (B. 11, p. 214.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>On this crannog about fifty tons of bones are said to have been
collected by the peasants and sold at two shillings per cwt. Of the
industrial remains of its occupiers the following relics were given

<h4>LOUGH RAVEL NEAR RANDALSTOWN.</h4>

<p>In addition to Sir W. R. Wilde's notes on the great crannog
near Randalstown (B. 24), some very interesting observations on
the antiquities found on it are given in the <i>Ulster Journal of
Archæology</i>, vol. vii., supplementary to Troyon's account of the
Swiss Lake-dwellings. (B. 27.) The most complete account, however,
is that of the late Mr. Ed. Benn, from which I take the following
extract:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The island near Randalstown," writes Mr. Benn, "was a very large and
important one, said to have been occupied by a member of the O'Neil
family. The lake on which it stood has been long since drained, and a
peat moss now occupies the place, which has been yielding antiquities
for the last twenty or thirty years, and still produces some annually.
A good idea of the importance of this island may be formed from the
number of tools and appliances for carrying on the ordinary trades
which have been discovered on it, as the tongs and anvil of the
smith, which latter is a rough lump of iron somewhat smoothed on one
side, and weighing fifty or sixty pounds. Its use as an anvil is
only conjecture; but it is thought a highly probable one, and, if
correct, it shows the difficulty of procuring in those rude times a
piece of iron large and heavy enough for such a purpose. Then there
were found also the crucibles of the brass-founder, one unused, and
several greatly worn and burned out. The perfect one is very neat and
good, and about the size of a small hen's egg. Then we have next the
scissors and two needles of the tailor; one of the needles is about
the size of what is called a darning-needle; the other long and strong
resembling a packing-needle, such as is used for sewing sackcloth:
both are made of brass, and well formed. There was also found the awl
of the shoemaker, a very curious article, and apparently older than
the other things; the blade of this awl is of brass, and the handle of
stone. Several axes or hatchets of the carpenter have turned up, very
like those of the present day; also a pair of small shears, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
are used by weavers. Connected with agriculture were found a very
small sock of a plough, a curious spade, very light, about four feet
long, all of wood, but neatly tipped with iron on the edge; and a
pair of very large shears, for clipping sheep. There was also a
netting-needle of iron; but few warlike weapons of any kind. None of
the latter, indeed, came within my observation but an iron sword and
a very good battle-axe, such as was used by the galloglasses; it is
shaped like the axe used by coopers, and is very interesting from its
rarity." The further objects described by Mr. Benn are pins of brass,
iron, bone, and wood, generally from 3 to 5 inches long; a large glass
bead and a small crescent-shaped piece of glass; a button with two
eyes; a horseshoe; a few fragments of pottery; a wooden scoop; a brass
dish 15 inches across, including the rim, which is an inch and a half
broad: it is rather more than 2 inches deep; some knives; a comb,
neatly made of bone and riveted with iron nails. "Besides the things
here enumerated, the bog around the Randalstown crannog has already
yielded several boats and parts of boats; these were all hollowed out
of large trees and were very well formed. One of large size, and quite
perfect, has been taken out lately from beneath sixteen feet of moss.
It has been stated, when first raised, it retained its original form
entire, but soon became warped and out of shape. In the bottom of this
boat lay a very neatly made oak paddle, about three feet and a half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
long, and a wooden bowl capable of holding nearly a quart. It was very
thick and rude-looking, not made by turning, but by hollowing out of a
solid piece, like the boat itself." (B. 29, p. 86.)</p>

<h4>TONYMORE.</h4>

<p>The next important lacustrine discoveries were made in the loch of
Tonymore, county Cavan. It appears that this small lake was celebrated
for its pike-fishing, and contained a dry mound or island about 50
yards in diameter, which was much resorted to by sportsmen. That
this island was a crannog was never suspected till a considerable
time after it had been drained in consequence of the railway having
to pass through it. Though wooden piles and some relics were then
found, the real nature of the discovery was not understood till the
publication of Sir W. R. Wilde's catalogue of the Museum of the Royal
Irish Academy in 1857, which gave an account of several similar
stations. Among the relics then collected at Tonymore were several
querns, sharpening stones, a yew bow, and (in the lake mud) two elks' heads.</p>

<p>In 1862 Lord Farnham caused further examination of the mound to be
made under Dr. Malcomson, of Cavan, from whose report the following
facts are derived (B. 60, p. 274):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The piles or stakes were arranged in two circles, one within the
other; the diameter of the greater one being 120 feet, that of the
other about ninety feet. The piles in the outer circle were very
numerous; and, in some instances, driven in close proximity to each
other. A few, having withstood the ravages of time, appeared about
three feet above the surface, and, upon being withdrawn and examined,
were found to have been carefully pointed. The stakes in the inner row
were not so numerous, nor were they altogether composed of oak, some
of them being of sallow or other soft wood.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Within the stockades were observed two small mounds (upon which
the grass was much more verdant than upon any other part of the
island), one at the north and the other at the south. Corresponding
with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg
373]</a></span> depression between these, and 3 feet under the soil,
we found, during the excavation, a flat stone, about four feet square
and 3 inches thick, resting on a number of upright blocks of decayed
oak. This, no doubt, was a hearthstone. Besides the wooden stakes
entering into the formation of the circles, others appear to have been
laid horizontally, their beam-like ends showing at that part of the
enclosure which was disturbed by the passage of the railway. When the
excavation had been carried to the centre, the cut surface presented,
from above downwards, the following section: 1st, clay; 2nd, black
and grey ashes with small stones and sand; 3rd, bones and ashes, with
lumps of blue and yellow clay; 4th, a quantity of grey ashes; and 5th,
the horizontal sleepers or stretchers, and hazel branches resting on
the peat bottom.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"On the same marsh, and about one hundred yards' distance from
the island, but nearer to Tonymore Castle, are two other stockaded
forts, on a raised plateau. They do not appear to have been islands,
as an elevated causeway leads from them to the mainland; but otherwise
they resemble the crannoge in their stockaded and mound-like appearance."</p>

<p>The antiquities collected on the crannog were presented to the
Museum of the Royal Irish Academy, among which were the following,
thus described by Sir W. R. Wilde:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"A very perfect quern, 17 inches in diameter, with the upper
surface of the top stone highly decorated; found at the bottom and
near the centre of the crannog. Several pieces of iron slag; a
barrel-shaped piece of wood 3&frac14; inches long, hollow throughout,
and perforated with six holes; three flat circular stone discs or
quoits, averaging 3&frac14; inches in diameter, and half an inch
thick; a most perfect and highly decorated mortar, 8 inches high
by 17&frac12; wide, decorated at the corners with four grotesque
figures; a stone mould; a four-sided whetstone 20 inches by 3, and
eleven fragments of smaller sharpening stones, of which two are perforated.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"A large oval and five globular stones; a flat red touchstone of
jasper and a stone shot 3 inches in diameter; two weapon-sharpeners
of remarkably hard stone.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Two large bone beads; a variegated enamel bead; a large
irregularly shaped amber bead; a smaller one of enamel paste, showing
a mixture of red, yellow, and blue colours; and also a small blue glass bead.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Two imperfect bone combs, like those already figured in the
catalogue at p. 272 (<b><a href="#Fig_105">Figs. 105</a></b>,
<b><a href="#Fig_108">108</a></b>, and <b><a href="#Fig_119">119</a></b>).</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"A bone ferrule 2&frac12; inches long, solid at one end.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Fourteen portions of pottery, some rudely glazed, others burned,
and some only backed; and consisting of fragments of various vessels
used either in the arts or for domestic and culinary purposes, such as
crucibles, pitchers, and bowls. Among these is a fragment of a bowl or
urn, of unglazed pottery, highly decorated with deeply grooved lines
on the outside, and slight indentations on the everted lip. It is of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
antiquity; composed of very black clay, darkened still more by the
long-continued action of the bog, and mixed with a quantity of
particles of white quartz or feldspar, which was probably added to
give it stability. A similar description of art may be remarked in
some of our oldest mortuary urns. When we consider that, except the
urns which must be referred to the Pagan period, we have scarcely any
examples of ancient Irish pottery, these specimens possess a peculiar
interest for the investigators of fictile ware.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Fragments of Kimmerage coal rings; probably part of a bracelet,
which seems to have been jointed at one end.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The bowls of two small pipes, similar to those in the Museum, and
usually but erroneously denominated 'Danish tobacco pipes.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"An enclosed ring of bronze, 3&frac14; inches in diameter; a large
decorated bronze pin, 7&frac12; inches long; and a smaller one,
3 inches in length.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"An iron knife-blade, with perforated haft, 8&frac12; inches long:
this article looks as if it had been attached to a long handle; a
smaller blade, with tang for haft, 2&frac34; inches in length; a
globular piece of iron 2&frac34; inches in diameter, like a crotal,
with an aperture on one side; the head of a small iron hammer; three
portions of rings, and eleven other iron fragments, the uses of which
have not been determined.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"A small perforated stone, like a whorl or distaff weight."
(<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 290.)</p>

<h4>FURTHER DISCOVERIES.</h4>

<p>Mr. G. H. Kinahan's observations on the Irish crannogs,
which now (1863) began to appear, have greatly contributed to
the dissemination of a correct knowledge of their structure and
geographical distribution. His notes on the crannogs of Lough Rea
(B. 58), Ballinlough (B. 70a), Lough Nahinch (B. 70b), and Lough
Naneevin (B. 118), which successively appeared in the Proceedings
of the Royal Irish Academy, were followed in 1872 by an article on
"Lake Stone-dwellings in Connaught" (B. 214), in which he shows that
in some cases dry stones were substituted for the ordinary wooden
structures and rubbish of which the artificial islands were usually
constructed&mdash;a fact which finds many parallel illustrations in Scotland.</p>

<p>Mr. Kinahan says that Reed's Island, Shore Island, Ash Island, and
Island M'Coo, in Loughrea, are crannogs; while Blake's Island may also
be one. From Shore Island 300 tons of bone were procured, among which
was the head of a <i>Megaceros Hibernicus</i> which measured 13 feet from
tip to tip of its horns. Amongst many relics found here made of stone,
horn, and wood were a few metal objects, as iron shears, a brass
pin, a crozier made of brass, a battle-axe, a cast for a coin,
and a hammered iron vessel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>The only other writer on Irish crannogs to whom I find it necessary
to allude in a special manner is Mr. W. F. Wakeman. Personally
acquainted with Petrie and Wilde, and probably deriving inspiration
from their enthusiastic devotion to archæology, and an eye-witness of
the first great crannog find at Dunshaughlin, Mr. Wakeman has ever
since been a careful observer of the antiquities of his country.
His special attention to crannogology dates only from 1870, but
since then scarcely a year has passed without his pen and pencil
being in requisition to record some fresh discovery in this field of
research.</p>

<p>In early times no district in Ireland presented more favourable
conditions for aquatic retreats than the county of Fermanagh, with its
countless lakes and bogs, interspersed and embosomed in the primeval
forests which were then extant. These advantages would appear to have
been fully recognised by the crannog-builders, as we find more remains
of these lacustrine abodes here than in any other part of the island.
The number of crannogs now recorded in this county amounts to about
40, but of course this is by no means the full quota that might be
disclosed by the adoption of a general system of exploration. Such
exhaustive methods of research have not as yet, however, taken deep
root in Ireland, so that the few reliable data of this character that
have come to light we cannot afford to pass over, even in this brief
sketch. The following extracts from Mr. Wakeman's reports are selected
for the purpose of illustrating the structure of these remains in this
part of Ireland, and the general character of the relics left on them
by their inhabitants.</p>

<h4>BALLYDOOLOUGH.</h4>

<p>Ballydoolough ("town of the dark loch") is a small sheet of
water some five miles from Enniskillen, in which there is a
small island which, in 1870, was recognised as a crannog, and
subsequently investigated.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"It contained, in wonderful preservation, three-fourths of the
foundation of its original log-house, the beams of which were mortised
together, and further fastened with pegs of oak. The antiquities
here discovered were very interesting, and consisted of stone, wood,
bronze, iron, a mixed metal, probably findruine, and pottery of which
I have given examples in this and former papers. The most curious
relic noticed here was an Ogham stone, which has been pronounced the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
most northern monument of its class yet discovered in Ireland.
The pieces of pottery were very numerous, and usually exhibited
ornamentation of an extremely early kind, amongst which chevron
patterns similar to those found upon 'sepulchral urns' were
conspicuous. The bronze articles were a thin plate of genuine antique
bronze, supposed to be part of a vessel; a looped pin about 4&frac34;
inches in length; a thin ribbon, and an article apparently belonging
to horse-furniture. Two iron knives, one of which had traces of
bronze-mounting, were also picked up: these resembled like articles
found in barrows in England. A brooch, partly composed of a white
metal, probably findruine, also occurred, as well as a portion of a
shoe of a small horse or ass. There were quern stones, whetstones, a
crucible, and numerous pieces of iron slag. All the portions of vases
found were composed of earth and sand, fire-hardened. There was no
glazing or trace of the use of the wheel. Many of the specimens were
furnished with handles or ears. A solitary vessel of wood, probably
yew, was discovered entire, but reduced almost to a state of pulp.
Among other relics were so-called sling-stones, immense quantities of
hazel-nuts, three canoes, each formed of a single piece of oak, and a
small oaken vessel formed of staves." (B. 217, p. 314.)</p>

<h4>"THE MIRACLES."</h4>

<p>At another locality bearing the singular name of "The Miracles,"
situated near Monea, and now a bog, but formerly a lake, a crannog was
revealed by the turf-cutters.</p>

<p>"Amongst the stone articles were the usual class of whetstones, and
two circular grinding-stones, the only specimens of their kind I have
ever heard of as having occurred in a crannog. The larger measures
8 inches across; the smaller is now in the Museum of our (Kilkenny)
Association, it having been presented by Mr. Plunket. The material of
both is close, yellow sandstone. The bones here were numerous, and of
the usual crannog class. Singlepiece canoes had from time to time been
found in the surrounding loch. The remains of pottery found here were
unimportant; but at least one very good crucible, as well as iron slag
and charcoal, were turned up." (B. 217, p. 320.)</p>

<h4>LOUGH EYES.</h4>

<p>Lough Eyes (anciently <i>Tobernasoul</i>, <i>i.e.</i> "the Well of
the Eyes"), a small lake only two-thirds of a mile long and a quarter
broad, contained a number of crannogs. The largest is 288 feet in
circumference, and has a maximum height above the lowest summer level
of 10 feet, and is therefore never entirely submerged. "Stockading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
still exists in a very interesting state of preservation. To the west
and north-west the stakes are four deep, and are placed so close
together as almost to touch. They are all, or nearly all, of oak,
roughly worked, and sharply pointed by a metal axe or adze."</p>

<p>A large quantity of broken pottery, like that from Ballydoolough,
and some flat pieces, apparently lids, and a club of deer-horn, were
found on it. Iron slag, pottery, bones, etc., were found on all these
crannogs. (B. 191, p. 553.)</p>

<h4>DRUMDARRAGH, OR TRILLICK.</h4>

<p>This lake is now nearly drained, and its crannog, which
measured 130 feet in diameter, has recently been re-investigated
by Mr. Wakeman, who thus describes the result:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Upon examination, the work presented the usual layers of bog,
earth, and stones, mixed with small trunks and boughs of ash, alder,
beech, yew, oak, and other trees. Here and there, at different levels,
were masses of ferns and furze. The outer edge was strongly piled with
young trees, of the description above referred to; the great majority,
however, being oak. Owing to the softness of the surroundings it
was impossible to completely trace the piling on the side of the
island which faces the ancient loch bed; but on what may be called
the land side the stakes formed six rows placed somewhat regularly,
with usually a space of about two feet between each set, sometimes,
however, they were close together, nearly touching. The stakes stood
about thirty inches asunder, and such of their numbers as were
disturbed for the purpose of examination presented sharply-pointed
ends, the result evidently of powerful and well-laid strokes of a very
keen metallic hatchet or adze.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Being anxious to find whether the crannog rested upon a frame
of timber, as a tradition of the place stated, and in order, if
possible, to discover the internal construction of the work, I caused
several trenches to be excavated in various places within the staked
enclosure, and then, with a long crowbar, probed as far as that
instrument would reach. The result was that we struck upon several
large and solid pieces of timber, but in what position they were
laid or whether in any way attached to others it was impossible to
determine, owing to the influx of water, and to the spongy character
of the bog-stuff, branches, etc., through which the iron pierced.
Throughout the island&mdash;placed apparently without any attempt at
symmetrical arrangement&mdash;were several stakes of the same kind,
but larger than any found in the inclosing lines of piles. These
timbers I believe to have been simply intended to act as stays or
binders to the body of the crannog. They certainly did not indicate
partitions. There was no trace of wattle-work, nor was there any
example of timber presenting mortise-holes observable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">
"During the process of excavation it became perfectly manifest
that the mound of the crannog was the work of three several periods.
Within a couple of feet of the present surface, near the centre of
the island, were found several large red sandstone flags, still
exhibiting traces of the action of fire, and surrounded by charcoal,
pieces of charred wood, bones of deer, sheep, pigs, goats, and other
animals, many of them evidently split for the marrow. Here also were
some fragments of pottery which had, no doubt, formed portions of
culinary vessels; part of an iron knife of early type; a second and
much smaller knife of iron, to which a wooden handle had been attached
by rivets; a piece of iron spirally twisted; a nail or pin of the same
metal, and a broken whetstone of the usual crannog class. I should
here observe that for many years past the mound had been subjected to
rude tillage, and consequent denudation, and that quern stones of the
'pot' and more ordinary type, belonging in all probability to this
layer, had been found near the hearth, and but a few inches above it.
These are now preserved in a neighbouring cottage.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The second hearth was about two and a half feet lower in the
soil, and placed at a distance of a few feet south-east of the
former, from which it scarcely differed, except that its vicinity
was much more prolific in bones, broken pottery, charcoal, and other
'kitchen-midden' waifs.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The third and lowest hearth, or rather fire-place, for no large
stones appeared, lay about eighteen inches lower than that last
described, and nearly beneath it. In connection with both, and mingled
generally in the soil&mdash;above, below, and for a considerable
distance around&mdash;were broken animal remains; innumerable teeth
of swine, deer, etc., boar-tusks; charcoal; 'burnt stones;' a bead of
jet; a bronze harp peg; an animal's head in iron, probably the leg of
a pot; an article of iron resembling a small, narrow, double axe-head
or pick; rude, oval-shaped hammer-stones; a well-formed knife of trap;
an admirably-worked 'thumbflint;' a core of flint from which flakes
had been struck; portion of a whetstone, and, finally, fragments
of the sides and bottoms of fictile vessels, together with ears or
handles of the same ware." (B. 441, p. 372.)</p>

<h4>COAL-BOG, NEAR BOHO.</h4>

<p>Mr. Plunket, who examined the remarkable find which was brought to light
here in 1880, thus describes the wooden structures met with:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"After a minute inspection, I perceived that we were standing on what
was once an artificial island, oval in shape, slightly elevated in the
centre, and dipping with a gentle slope on all sides, the outlines of
which can still be easily traced. It is 60 yards long, and 14 yards
across at its greatest width. Piles, or stakes, with rudely-sharpened
ends and varying in size, are found at intervals all over this area,
and rough oak planks, about the size of railway sleepers, may be seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
lying in rows here and there, and generally resting on a layer of
branches, the whole being covered over with a stratum of clay and
stones, mingled with charcoal and ashes. It is quite manifest that
this is the site of an ancient crannog, or artificial island. The
surrounding depression, now filled with peat, known as the Coal-Bog,
and covering some scores of acres, once formed a large sheet of water."
(B. 345, p. 66.)</p>

<p>Here perforated posts and frameworks of what were supposed to have
been wooden huts were found. In one place a wooden structure measuring
11 feet 10 inches by 6 feet 3 inches, formed of rude wooden beams,
with roughly-executed mortises, was found no less than 21 feet below
the surface of the peat. Two flint implements, several fragments of
hand-made pottery, devoid of ornamentation, broken hazel-nut shells,
and in the vicinity, at the same depth in the peat, a few wooden
dishes. The stool of a huge <i>pine tree</i>, which, "before its decay,
must have measured 14 feet in diameter," was found 2 feet above the
level of the floor of the hut, which sent its roots downwards.</p>

<p>Subsequently Mr. Wakeman states that near this crannog
lumps of "bog butter," rolled up in cow-hides, were found, and
that the wood of the huge root of the tree above referred to
turned out on analysis to be <i>yew</i>, and not pine.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<h4>LISNACROGHERA.</h4>

<p>Amongst the more recently discovered lake-dwellings were one
at Lisnacroghera, near Broughshane, and two in Lough Mourne, both
localities being in county Antrim. The former came into notice some
six years ago in consequence of the discovery in a peat bog of some
remarkable iron swords, with bronze sheaths, together with other
military weapons. The bog in which these objects were found occupies
the site of a former lake, which, till recently, retained so much
water as to prevent the working of the peat for fuel. To remedy this
the outlet was deepened, and so new or undisturbed portions of the
bog were brought within reach of the peat-cutters. The antiquities
were found from time to time in a circumscribed area, within a small
plot belonging to one of the neighbouring farmers. When attention was
first directed to the locality, and the workers questioned as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
circumstances in which the relics came to light, it appears that some
kind of wooden structure was encountered, which, however, had been
entirely removed before being seen by anyone competent to form an
opinion as to its nature. In August, 1866, I visited the locality,
and closely questioned the farmer about this woodwork, but failed to
elicit any definite information. He was quite clear, however, about
the existence of stakes and irregularly disposed beams and brushwood,
which at the time he thought little about. From his description,
and some remnants of oak beams, some showing the usual mortises,
there can, I think, be little doubt that it was a crannog, but of no
great dimensions. Close to where the peat had been cut there is an
undisturbed structure of stones just cropping through the turf, which
may yet turn out to have some relationship with the crannog. As to
the relics, there is no record of their association with the crannog
beyond the fact of their being found in its vicinity. Canon Grainger,
who has taken much interest in this find, has secured for his private
museum a large number of the relics from Lisnacroghera, but he fears
that, since the crannog has become famous, he has occasionally been
imposed upon by having presented to him, as coming from it, objects
which in reality had been found elsewhere. This, in my opinion,
partly explains the presence of such incongruous objects as are now
to be seen in the Canon's collection. Among these are especially
some arrow-heads and scrapers of flint which cannot be distinguished
from analogous objects picked up on the neighbouring fields. Besides
the weapons with bronze mountings, there is in short an assortment
of remains which might be classed as belonging to all ages&mdash;a
stone celt, rubbers, flint arrow-heads and scrapers, down to an
iron reaping-hook, a hedge-cutter's knife, and a portion of an old gunlock.</p>

<p>But the special interest of the Lisnacroghera crannog lies in the
remarkable series of military weapons which it has yielded, consisting
of iron swords and ornamented sheaths of bronze, iron spears with long
wooden handles and bronze mountings, together with a variety of other bronze
objects, probably the mountings of shields. These I shall now proceed to describe.

Sword Sheaths of Bronze. All <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Sword-sheaths.</i>&mdash;Up to the present time four sheaths
(<b><a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a></b>, Nos. 1 to 4) have been
recovered, but only one is entire, the
rest being more or less in a fragmentary condition. They are all made
of thin bronze riveted together at the margins, and over this there
is a bead which, towards the lower third, develops into an elegant
ornamentation very similar to that which we have already seen on the
sword-sheaths of La Tène (See <b><a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a></b>.) The perfect
sheath (No. 1) is devoid of ornamentation, except that formed by the marginal bead;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
but the other three (of which only one side of each remains) are
decorated with highly artistic designs formed by incised lines, the
details of which will be readily seen from the illustrations. No.
1, which still retains the blade of an iron sword firmly adhered
to it, is 17&frac12; inches long. No. 2 is defective at the tip,
besides having lost its surrounding bead; it measures, in its
present condition, 19 inches in length. The illustration here is a
reproduction of a rubbing reduced half size and shows only the upper
half. The design which comes out in white lines is in reality incised
lines and corresponds to the dark lines in the other two. No. 3, the
largest of the group, measures 22 inches in length. Both ends are
here represented. No. 4 is the smallest, being only 16&frac12; inches
in length. It is supposed that the incised lines, which are sharply
defined and deeply cut, contained a black enamel, but no traces of
it now remain. The circular cavities in the surrounding bead at the
tips were also intended for the reception of enamel, probably of
some brilliant colour. These designs, which belong to the so-called
"late Celtic" style of ornamentation, when so treated must have had a
striking effect on the bright bronze surface.</p>

<p>In Nos. 1 and 4 it will be observed that there is a transverse
raised band, the purpose of which was, no doubt, to strengthen
the sheath. Such bands were a feature in the La Tène sheaths,
which in some instances were repeated several times at intervals
on the body of the sheath. In Canon Grainger's collection I saw
one or two broad rings compressed in the middle, which I took
to be the cross-bands of other sheaths.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
<i>Swords.</i>&mdash;The swords which belonged to these sheaths were all
of iron, a fact which probably accounts for their being in a more
dilapidated condition. Of four recovered up to this date only one
is in a good and perfect condition (<b><a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a></b>, No. 1).
Its total length is 19&frac12; inches, of which the handle takes up five
inches, measuring from the extremity of the tang to the nearest part
of the curved ridge which separates it from the blade. The blade has
a sharply defined ridge and tapers gracefully to a point. The other
swords are all fragmentary. One, as already mentioned, is still in
its sheath; another, portion of a blade 14 inches long, has a sharp
central ridge and otherwise corresponds exactly with the entire
weapon. Of the fourth there remains merely the handle (No. 2), the
blade having apparently disappeared by oxidation. So far it also
closely corresponds with the entire weapon. Both handles have bronze
mountings, which, though differing in some details, are so peculiar
in their plan and method of execution, that we have no hesitation in
recognising them as belonging to one and the same group&mdash;a group
which, so far as my knowledge goes, finds its parallel only in a few
examples from La Tène. (See <b><a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a></b>, Nos. 7 and 8.)
As to the material of which the grip was made there is no evidence. The bronze
circlets and flanges on the tangs, if in their original position,
involve the necessity of having the handles, whether of bone or
horn, divided in several pieces. That these bronze sheaths and iron
swords were counterparts of each other there can be no reasonable
doubt. Their points of agreement, besides general dimensions and
style of manufacture, are too remarkable to be accidental. Thus
the peculiar curve at the opening of the sheaths fits that of the
band of separation between the handle and blade of the swords. Also
the prominent midribs in the two sword-blades have corresponding
prominences in two of the sheaths (Nos. 3 and 4).</p>

<p><i>Lances.</i>&mdash;Though there is only one spear-head in the
Lisnacroghera collection, there is ample evidence to show that it
was not an isolated example of this kind of weapon. Certain objects,
like the brass knob of a door (Nos. 28, 29, and 30), amounting in all
to seven or eight, are now known to have adorned the butt end of the
wooden handles of so many spears. One of these handles, 8 feet in
length, though now greatly shrunk and contorted, is still preserved by
Canon Grainger and conclusively proved their use as well as that of
some other objects which previously seemed equally mysterious. At the
other end of the spear-shaft, close to where it entered the socket,
was a ferrule of the same style of art as the sword-sheaths (Nos. 23,
24, and 25). Several of these ferrules have been found which, like the
ornaments on the butt end, differ considerably in regard to size. They
are all ornamented with elegant designs in incised lines which also,
it is supposed, contained enamel. One is here represented with a piece
of the handle and a bronze rivet (No. 23), probably that which fixed
the spear more firmly in its shaft; but of the spear itself nothing
remains. The only spear-head that has been found is of iron. It is
a magnificent blade 16&frac12; inches in length, with a slim socket
containing two rivets (No. 3).</p>

<p>A curious object here represented as No. 27 consists of an oval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
ring, "richly decorated with bands, in which are remains of white and
red enamelled designs in a chevron or wavy pattern." On one edge there
are two forms like that of a bird. Mr. Wakeman considers it to be the
terminal ornament or pommel to a sword or dagger. (B. 411, p. 391.)</p>

<p><i>Various Bronze Mountings.</i>&mdash;Among the other objects which
from their character and style of art belonged to the same group as we
have just described are the following:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Two ornaments of
thin bronze in repoussé. One is a disc (No. 22), slightly impaired at
the margin, bearing in the centre a triquetrum of symmetrical spirals,
and surrounded by a slightly raised border. The other (No. 20) is
in a more fragmentary condition, but sufficient remains to show the
design to be a <i>swastika</i> or <i>croix gammée</i>, worked after the same
fashion as the former and probably serving as the central ornament of
a disc. (<i>b</i>) Three cup-shaped ornaments each having a small aperture
in the centre. One (No. 18) is surrounded by a broad margin like a
wide-awake hat, which is copiously ornamented with incised lines. On
the supposition that this was intended to adorn the face of a wooden
shield the cup must have been embedded in the wood, as it is clear
that its concave side is the front, there being no ornamentation on
the other. Another of the same kind is represented by No. 19, and
differs from the former only by having a smaller and less decorated
border. In a third specimen the ornamented border entirely disappears,
and its place is taken by a marginal bead. (<i>d</i>) A variety of annular
and penannular rings, some hollow (Nos. 6 and 7) and others solid
(No. 17). Some, as Nos. 8 and 9, are ornamented with designs (one of
which still retains an enamel of a vermilion tint) and were probably
attached to pins and used as ring-brooches. A curious object like
a doubly coiled bangle with the coils adherent and ornamented with
zig-zag lines is supposed to have been the rim of an oval brooch (No.
15). (<i>e</i>) A plain but elegantly shaped drinking-cup of thin bronze
(No. 10) has neither handle nor any marks of rivets. (<i>f</i>) Among minor
things are a couple of bronze pins, one with a round top and the other
with a small ring; also a rude finger ring (No. 16), an ornamental
stud (No. 21), and a rivet with one side deeply serrated like a
cog-wheel (No. 26).</p>

<p>In addition to the above list of objects, all of which may be
considered as part of one special and indeed unique group which by
some chance found their way into the Lisnacroghera crannog, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
are others similar to the usual class of crannog relics; and among
these I have noted the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Iron.</i>&mdash;Two large iron cauldrons in a fragmentary state;
a large curved knife, like that of a hedge-cutter, still retaining
its wooden handle; an axe (No. 4), also containing a portion of
the handle; an adze (No. 5); a reaping hook; portion of a gunlock,
together with various bits of an undefined character.</p>

<p><i>Beads.</i>&mdash;Several coloured and variegated beads (blue, red,
and white) (Nos. 11, 12, and 14). One bead is of stone, another large
one is of jet, and another of amber (No. 13).</p>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;One small stone axe of a dark colour and
wedge-shaped, some elongated four-sided hones, hammer-stones, etc.; a
few flint flakes, and rude arrow-points.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;A few fragments of coarse earthenware, indicating
large wide-mouthed vessels.</p>

<p><i>Miscellaneous.</i>&mdash;A portion of "bog-butter" bearing the
impression of a coarse cloth. Several pieces of wood with round and
square-cut holes.</p>

<h4>LOUGH MOURNE.</h4>

<p>In consequence of the partial drainage of Lough Mourne during the
summer of 1882, while its basin was being converted into a reservoir
for the supply of water to the town of Belfast, two artificial
islands became exposed which were at once recognised to be the
remains of submerged lake-dwellings. Shortly after exposure I visited
them in company with Mr. Robinson, the assistant engineer to the
Belfast waterworks, and subsequently recorded my observations in the
Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (B. 439), of
which the following is a short abstract.</p>

<p>The first, which was easily accessible on foot, was very much
disturbed by the repeated "howkings" of visitors. Its form, as
determined by the area containing the stumps of piles, was irregularly
circular, but nowhere exceeding 60 feet in diameter. Included within
this area were four small separate elevations, composed of a few
stones, clay, and ashes interspersed with burnt twigs and bits of
charcoal. None of these elevations had as large a diameter as 10
feet, and it only required one turn over of the spade to reach the
undisturbed bed of the lake. Digging on these so-called islets, and in
the spaces around them, I found stumps of upright piles and fragments
of burnt faggots, the latter forming a thin layer over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
true lake-sediment. The piles were closely set, about one or one
and a half foot apart, and uniformly occupied the whole area of the
dwelling without any appearance of circular stockades; nor was
there any semblance of a fascine-structure indicating an artificially
constructed island. From the margin or outskirts of the area
occupied by these piles a double row of stumps extended towards
the shore, which, on being traced, were found to have stopped half
way to the ordinary water-level mark. The conclusion which I
came to was that this lacustrine dwelling was a true palafitte,
over whose wooden platform two or three hearths were constructed
of incombustible materials, as stone and clay. Probably these
hearths would have been surrounded by some kind of huts.
During the conflagration which had destroyed the entire wooden
structures (of which final catastrophe there appeared little doubt
from the amount of burnt faggots and beams that lay scattered
over the lake bed all over the area containing piles), the materials
of these hearths would ultimately drop down to the bottom of the
lake, still, however, retaining their relative position, and so present
the appearance of low mounds over the bed of the lake with the
stumps of their supporting piles penetrating them.</p>

<p>Among the relics recorded from this lake-dwelling are "two
small stone crucibles" (B. 320), an iron hatchet, part of a canoe, a
hammer-stone, a rubbing-stone, two small urns (?), part of a large
crucible, charred bones, teeth, shells of hazel-nuts. (B. 439, p. 324.)
Flint flakes, scrapers, and arrow-points have been found in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
vicinity along the shore, but on the crannog itself only a quantity
of fine chips was discovered. Some of these relics I saw in the
possession of a young man of the name of Macdonald, who lived in
the neighbourhood and took an active part in searching for relics.
The iron hatchet turned out to be of exceptional interest. It is a
socketed celt, with a loop at one side for fixing the handle, part
of which was still remaining in the socket. (<b><a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a></b>,
No. 1.) Bronze celts of this description are, of course, very common,
but specimens made of iron are extremely rare, especially in the
British Isles, and only exceptionally to be seen in the museums
of Europe. This is the only one hitherto recorded from a British
lake-dwelling, and, moreover, it is, as regards size and form, quite
unique. It measures 6&frac34; inches long and 3&frac14; inches broad
immediately above the cutting edge. The longest diameter of the
socket is 2&frac12; inches, and this breadth is continued for about
two-thirds of its length, except where the loophole causes it to
bulge outwards.</p>

<p>One of the crucibles, which I believe is now presented to the
Belfast Museum, is rather peculiar in having a short projecting
handle (No. 2).</p>

<p>It would thus appear that the inhabitants of this lake-dwelling
practised the art of metallurgy, which would entail at least one
fire-proof furnace, and thus partly account for the existence of so
many hearths on such a small area.</p>

<p>The second dwelling was about 150 yards from the shore,
in deep water, and lying over a great depth of quaking mud.
It was a small example of the ordinary stockaded island, but
owing to the softness of the mud and oozing of water no satisfactory
investigation could be undertaken. Mr. Robinson calculates
the extent of its submergence at 15 feet. Its entire surface
was occupied by a heap of stones which gave it the appearance of
a hillside cairn. Digging underneath these stones we came upon
a thick bed of heather and brackens interspersed with beams and
brushwood. Near the margin were to be seen a few piles and
beams rudely mortised, from which one or two long beams radiated
towards the centre like the spokes of a wheel.</p>

<p>In the first described lake-dwelling no submergence could have
taken place, as the lake bottom was composed of compact sand
in which the piles had a firm hold.</p>

<p>In different parts of the lake two single-tree canoes were found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
embedded in the mud, both of which are now preserved in the Belfast
Museum. One is a plain trough of a rectangular shape with slightly
sloping sides, measuring 12&frac12; feet long, 2&frac12; wide and 9
inches deep (No. 3). Its flat base is perforated with six circular
holes &frac34; inch in diameter. The other is pointed at both ends,
and altogether much more artistic in its structure. It was originally
about 13 feet long and 3&frac12; feet wide, but the fore-part is
considerably damaged. The stern portion is here figured (No. 4). It
had two seats formed of neat planks of oak, seven inches broad, and
supported on projecting ledges on each side cut out of the solid, as
shown in the section No. 6. The seats (No. 5) were kept in position by
two wooden pins at each end which penetrated into the solid supports.
For the oars there were also two arrangements on each side consisting
of perforated projections left out of the solid as shown on the margin
of the portion here sketched. But the most remarkable feature of this
canoe consists of four prominences with abrupt edges (also left in the
solid) for the feet of the rowers, as seen in the illustration. The
distances from the centre of the seats to their corresponding foot
marks were 33 and 34 inches respectively.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;SCOTTISH LAKE-DWELLINGS OR CRANNOGS.</h3>

<p>It was not till after the discoveries on the Continent had
attracted universal attention that archæologists began to look for
similar remains in Britain. It was then found that early historic
references to island forts, and some incidental notices of the
exposure of buried islands artificially constructed of wood and stone,
and other remains of lacustrine abodes, during the drainage of lochs
and marshes in the last and early part of this century, had been
entirely overlooked. The merit of correctly interpreting these remains
in Scotland, and bringing them systematically before antiquaries,
belongs to the late Joseph Robertson, Esq., F.S.A., Scotland, who read
a paper on the subject to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland on
the 14th of December, 1857, entitled, "Notices of the Isle of the Loch
of Banchory, the Isle of Loch Canmor, and other Scottish examples of
the artificial or stockaded islands, called crannogs in Ireland, and
Keltischen Pfahlbauten in Switzerland."</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson's paper, though not published, at once attracted
attention, and stimulated so much further inquiry on the part of
the members, that, at the very next meeting of the Society, another
contribution on the subject was read by Mr. John Mackinlay, F.S.A.,
Scotland (B. 21), from which it appeared that as early as 1812 this
gentleman had observed some remains (now surmised to be a crannog)
in Dhu Loch, in the island of Bute, which were described in a letter
dated the 13th February, 1813. This communication found its way
to George Chalmers, Esq., author of "Caledonia," regarding which,
writing on the 26th of April, 1813, he says:&mdash;"It goes directly
to illustrate some of the obscurest antiquities of Scotland. I mean
the wooden castles, which belong to the Scottish period when stone
and lime were not much used in building. I will make proper use of
this discovery of Mr. Mackinlay." In 1863, Dr. John Grigor, of Nairn,
described "two ancient lake-dwellings or crannoges in the Loch of the
Clans, Nairnshire." (B. 55.) The remains, however, were too imperfect
to be of value in illustrating their structure, and the only relics
found were a portion of a small stone cup or lamp, two whetstones, an
iron axe-head, and some charcoal and bits of bone.</p>

<p>A more important discovery, made about the same time, was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
group of artificial islands in Loch Dowalton, Wigtownshire, which were
first described by his Grace the Duke of Northumberland (then Lord
Lovaine) in a paper read at the Newcastle-upon-Tyne meeting of the
British Association in 1863. (B. 56.) About two years later Mr. John
Stuart, Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, visited
Dowalton, and, owing to a greater drainage of the loch having been
made in the interval, was enabled to re-examine the Dowalton islands
under more favourable circumstances. The result of his labours was an
elaborate paper to the Society, in which he gave a detailed account
of the structure and relics of these crannogs, and also took the
opportunity of incorporating into his article all the facts he could
glean, so as to afford a basis for comparing the Scottish examples
with those in other countries. (B. 94.)</p>

<p>Since the publication of Dr. Stuart's paper in 1866, little
progress was made in the investigation of Scottish crannogs, though
traces of them were occasionally noticed in various parts of Scotland,
till the discovery and examination of the Lochlee crannog, Ayrshire,
in 1878-9. The work done at Lochlee was important, not only because of
the varied collection of relics secured, but also on account of the
interest it had excited in archæological research, the fruit of which
has already been reaped by the discovery of no less than five other
lake-dwellings in the south-west of Scotland, all of which have now
been carefully investigated. Full details of these investigations are
given in the Collections of the Ayrshire and Galloway Archæological
Association, as well as in my recent work on the "Scottish
Lake-Dwellings." (B. 331, 344, 373, and 426.)</p>

<p>While such general indications of lake-dwellings can hardly be
said to limit their geographical distribution to any given area in
Scotland, it is a singular fact that, so far as the discovery of
actual remains illustrative of the civilisation and social condition
of their occupiers is concerned, we are almost entirely dependent on
the investigations made at Dowalton, Lochlee, Lochspouts, Buston,
Airrieoulland, Barhapple, and Friar's Carse, all of which are situated
within the counties of Ayr, Dumfries, and Wigtown. In instituting
a comparison between the relics of these respective groups their
resemblance is so wonderfully alike that we have no difficulty in
dispensing with the necessity of discussing the merits of each group
separately; so that whatever inferences can be legitimately derived
from a critical examination of any one group may be safely applied to the whole.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>As a preliminary to this inquiry the following details of the
investigation of lake-dwellings in Scotland will, I trust, be
sufficient to give general readers a tolerably correct notion of the
social conditions and environments of the people whose history,
solely from an archæological standpoint, it is our object here to pourtray.</p>

<h4>DOWALTON.</h4>

<p>The loch of Dowalton was of an irregular form, about 1&frac12; mile
long, and about three-quarters of a mile in greatest breadth, and
without any marked outfall for drainage. Sir William Maxwell effected
this by making a cut, 25 feet deep, through the wall of whinstone
and slate which closed it in at its south-eastern boundary. When the
waters were allowed to run off in the summer of 1863 no less than
five artificially constructed islands became visible. One of these
had a cairn of stones on it which always remained above water, and
was known as the "Miller's Cairn," from the fact of its having been
used, like the Nilometer, to measure the quantity of water in the
lake, and thereby to regulate its supply to neighbouring mills. "On
approaching the cairn," says Dr. Stuart, "the numerous rows of piles
which surrounded it first attracted notice. These piles were formed of
young oak-trees. Lying on the north-east were mortised frames of beams
of oak, like hurdles, and, below these, round trees laid horizontally.
In some cases the vertical piles were mortised into horizontal bars.
Below them were layers of hazel and birch branches, and under these
were masses of ferns, the whole mixed with large boulders, and
penetrated by piles. Above all was a surface of stone and soil, which
was several feet under water till the recent drainage took place. The
hurdle frames were neatly mortised together, and were secured by pegs
in the mortise holes. On one side of the island a round space of a few
feet in size appeared, on which was a layer of white clay, browned
and calcined as from the action of fire, and around it were bones of
animals and ashes of wood.... Lines of piles, apparently to support a
causeway, led from it to the shore." (B. 94.)</p>

<p>The other islands were constructed in a similar manner, and
of like materials. The largest and farthest from the shore
measured twenty-three yards in diameter, and its surface was
three feet lower than that of the others. Several canoes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
bronze dishes were found in the mud in the vicinity of these
islands, and in making excavations on them many relics and
broken bones were collected, of which the following is a list
as far as known up to the present time:&mdash;</p>

<h4>RELICS FROM THE CRANNOGS IN LOCH DOWALTON.</h4>

<p><i>Metal.</i>&mdash;"Pot or patella of yellowish-coloured bronze
(<b><a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a></b>), with a handle springing from the
upper edge, 7 inches in length, on which is stamped the letters P. CIPIPOLIBI.
At the farther extremity is a circular opening. The bottom is ornamented
with five projecting rings, and measures in diameter 6 inches; it is 8
inches in diameter across the mouth; the inside appears to be coated
with tin, and has a series of incised lines at various distances. The
vessel is ornamented on the outside opposite to the handle by a human
face in relief, surrounded by a movable ring, which could be used in
lifting the pot." (B. 94, p. 109.)</p>

<h4>LOCHLEE.</h4>

<p>The site of the Lochlee crannog was a small lake, which
formerly occupied about nineteen acres of what is now, and has been
for many years, arable land, on the farm of Lochlee, near Tarbolton.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
Before it was artificially drained, some fifty years ago, no one
appears to have surmised that a small island, which became visible
in the summer-time, and formed a safe habitation for gulls and
other sea-birds during their breeding season, had been formerly the
residence of man; nor does it appear to have attracted the attention
of the poet Burns, who lived on this farm for four years as ploughman
to his father, then tenant of the place. The crannog was near the
outlet, of the lake, and the nearest land, its southern bank, was
about seventy-five yards distant. When the first drainage of the lake
was carried out, the wrought woodwork exposed in the drains running
through the island, and especially the discovery of two canoes buried
in the moss, attracted some attention. It was not, however, till 1878,
in consequence of some discoveries during the re-drainage of the
locality, that this most important crannog was investigated.</p>

<p>The general appearance which it presented before the excavations
were commenced, as seen in <b><a href="#Fig_135">Fig. 135</a></b>, was that of
a grassy knoll, drier, firmer, and slightly more elevated than the surrounding
field. Towards the margin of this mound were seen the tops of a
few wooden piles, barely projecting above the grass, which at once
suggested the idea that they might be portions of a stockaded island.

of surrounding Stockade with Mortised Beams.</p>
</div>

<p>The diameter of the island was about one hundred feet; and its
superficies was thus occupied:&mdash;In the centre was a flat circular
area about sixty feet in diameter. Then followed a double line of
upright piles from 2 to 3 feet apart. These were bound together by
short transverse beams with a hole, generally square, at each end
(<b><a href="#Fig_136">Fig. 136</a></b>), into which the tops of the uprights
penetrated, while others stretched along the circumference forming a firm network.
The surface of these horizontal binders was about three feet above
the level of the inner area, and thus the stockade presented the
appearance of a breastwork. At the north-east corner this arrangement
was more perfect than elsewhere (see sketch, <b><a href="#Fig_137">Fig. 137</a></b>) and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
constituted what was supposed to have been a landing stage, as from it
a neatly-constructed flooring of wood extended for some yards inwards.
Outside the stockade on the north side there was a mass of brushwood
and stakes forming a kind of trellis-work, as if intended for further
protection to the island. In the centre of the inner area there was a
square portion, measuring 39 feet on each side, covered with closely
laid beams of split stems of trees having the appearance and size
of railway sleepers, which appeared to have been the flooring of a
wooden house. This log-pavement (as we called it) had been Surrounded
by a wooden wall, the stumps of which then only remained, and a line
of similar stumps ran across it, from east to west, thus bisecting
the building into two nearly equal compartments. The sides of this
wooden foundation looked towards the four cardinal points, and its
corners just reached to the surrounding stockades. On the surface of
the wooden pavement were found some fragments of curiously worked
beams and some large broad boards. Some were grooved and had also
square-cut holes, in which both transverse and upright beams could
be mortised. (See sketch, <b><a href="#Fig_138">Fig. 138</a></b>.) A doorway,
the stumps of the sideposts of which were readily distinguished, opened to the
south; and in front, but more to the left, was an extensive refuse
heap, in which many relics were found. This midden occupied the space
between the south margin of the log-pavement and the surrounding
stockades&mdash;some 10 or 12 feet in breadth by about double
that in length.</p>

  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 139</b>.&mdash;Perpendicular
Section through the Three lowest Hearths.</p>
</div>

<p>About the middle of the northern half of the log-pavement was found
a remarkable series of four hearths, or fire-places, superimposed
one above the other. The lowest was placed a little above the
log-pavement, and had a layer of stones, clay, and earth intervening
between it and the wood. About one and a half foot higher there was a
second hearth; at a similar interval, a third; and at 2&frac12; feet
still higher, a fourth. These hearths were formed of small boulders
laid closely together, like a stone causeway, embedded in, and
surrounded by, a layer of clay (<b><a href="#Fig_139">Fig. 139</a></b>). They
were oval or circular in shape and about four feet in diameter. The corresponding
layers of clay extended considerably beyond the limits of the hearths
around which they appeared to form a flooring. The third hearth
(counting from below upwards) had been more elaborately constructed
than the others, and it was surrounded by a number of stumps of stout
uprights which no doubt were the remains of a secondary building,
as their lower ends did not penetrate much beyond the level of the
hearth. The space underneath the clay bed corresponding to this
hearth, and extending downwards to the log-pavement, was, next to the
refuse heap, the most prolific in relics. In it were found, about the
level of the second fire-place, nearly the entire skeletons of two
animals like a goat or sheep, the skulls of which had short horn-cores
attached to them.</p>

<p><i>Gangway.</i>&mdash;Beyond the midden, outside the island, the
tops of a few piles were detected, and upon making exploratory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
excavations, these turned out to be the remains of a gangway.
As this structure was very peculiar and somewhat comparable to
the wooden structures described by Virchow and others in the
German Pfahlbauten, I will here quote my original description of
it <i>in extenso</i>. (See plan and sections, facing <a href="#Page_416">page 416</a>):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"We commenced this inquiry by excavating a rectangular space,
30 feet long, 16 feet broad, and 3 to 4 feet deep, in the line of
direction indicated by the piles, and exposed quite a forest of oak
stakes. Other trenches were then made with exactly similar results.
The stakes thus revealed did not at first appear to conform to any
systematic arrangement, but by-and-by we detected, in addition to
six single piles, small groups of three, four, and five, here and
there at short intervals. This observation, however, conveyed little
or no meaning, so that we could form no opinion as to the manner in
which they were used. Up to this point no trace of mortised beams was
anywhere to be seen. In all these trenches the stuff dug up was of the
same character. First or uppermost was a bed of fine clay rather more
than 2 feet thick, and then a soft dark substance formed of decomposed
vegetable matter. The source of the latter was evident from the
occurrence in its upper stratum of large quantities of leaves, some
stems, branches, and the roots of stunted trees <i>in situ</i>. The tops
of the piles in the trench next the crannog were from 2 to 3 feet below
the surface of the field, but they rose gradually as we receded from
the crannog, and in the trench next the shore one or two were found on
a level with the grass. About 4 feet deep the stuff at the bottom of
the trench was so soft that a man could scarcely stand on it without
sinking ankle-deep. It was not nearly so heavy as the upper strata,
but more adhesive, and of a nutty-brown colour, which, on exposure,
quickly turned dark. Notwithstanding the flabbiness of this material,
the piles felt quite firm, and this fact, together with the experience
derived from our examination of the deeper structures of the island,
led to the supposition that the piles must terminate in some more
solid basis than had yet been made apparent. To remove all doubts on
this point, though a long iron rod could be easily pushed downwards
without meeting any resistance, we ordered a large deep shaft to be
dug in the line of the piles, and the cutting nearest the crannog was
selected for this purpose. This was accomplished with much difficulty,
but we were amply rewarded by coming upon an elaborate system of
woodwork, which I found no less difficult to comprehend than it now is
to describe. The first horizontal beam was reached about 7 feet deep,
and for other 3 feet we passed through a complete network of similar
beams, lying in various directions. Below this&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> 10 feet
from the surface&mdash;the workmen could find no more beams and the
lake silt became harder and more friable. We then cleared a larger
area, so as, if possible, to exhibit the structural arrangement of the
woodwork. The reason of grouping the piles now became apparent. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
groups were placed in a somewhat zig-zag fashion near the sides of the
gangway, and from each there radiated a series of horizontal beams,
the ends of which crossed each other and were kept in position by the
uprights. One group was carefully inspected. The first or lowest beam
observed was right across, the next lay lengthways and of course at
right angles to the former, then three or four spread out diagonally
like a fan, and terminated in other groups at the opposite side of the
gangway, and lastly, one again lay lengthways. Thus each beam raised
the level of the general structure the exact height of its thickness,
though large lozenge-shaped spaces remained in the middle quite clear
of any beams. The general breadth of the portion of this unique
structure examined was about 10 feet (but an isolated pile was noticed
farther out), and its thickness varied from 3 to 4 feet. A large oak
plank, some 10 feet long, showing the marks of the sharp-cutting
instrument by which it was formed, was found lying on edge at its west
side, and beyond the line of piles, but otherwise no remains of a
platform were seen. All the beams and stakes were made of oak, and so
thoroughly bound together that, though not a single joint, mortise, or
pin was discovered, the whole fabric was as firm as a rock. No relics
were found in any of the excavations along the line of this gangway."
(B. 373, pp. 99-101.)</p>

<p><i>Structure of the Island.</i>&mdash;Having now collected the chief
facts regarding the log-pavement, its surrounding structures and
superincumbent materials, we determined to sink a shaft about the
centre of the crannog for the purpose of ascertaining, if possible,
the thickness, composition, and mode of structure, of the island
itself. This shaft was rectangular in form, and large enough to
allow three men to work in it together. (See plan and sections,
<a href="#Page_416">page 416</a>.) After removing the three or four layers of
oak planks which constituted this portion of the log-pavement, we came upon
a thin layer of brushwood, and then large trunks of trees laid in regular
beds or layers, each layer having its logs lying parallel to each
other, but transversely or sometimes obliquely to those of the layer
immediately above or below it. At the west end of the trench, after
removing the first and second layers of the log-pavement, we found
part of a small canoe hollowed out of an oak trunk, evidently part of
an old worn-out one, thus economised and used instead of a prepared
log. Much progress in this kind of excavation was by no means an easy
task, as it was necessary to keep two men constantly pumping the
water which copiously flowed from all directions into the trench, and
even then there always remained some at the bottom. As we advanced
downwards we encountered layer upon layer of the trunks of trees with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
the branches closely chopped off, and so soft that the spade easily
cut through them. Birch was the prevailing kind of wood, but,
occasionally, beams of oak were found with holes at their extremities,
through which pegs of oak penetrated into other holes in the logs
beneath. One such peg, some three or four inches in diameter, was
found to pass through no less than four beams in successive layers,
and to terminate ultimately in a round trunk over thirteen inches in
diameter. One of the oak beams was extracted entire, and measured
8 feet 3 inches in length and 10 inches in breadth, and the holes
in it were 5 feet apart. Others had small round projecting bars,
which fitted into mortised holes in adjacent beams. Down to a depth
of about four feet the logs ware rudely split, but below this they
were round rough trunks, with the bark still adhering to them. Their
average diameter would be from six inches to one foot, and amongst
them were some curiously gnarled stems occasionally displaying large
knotty protuberances. Of course, in the act of digging the trench
the wood was cut up into fragments, and, on being uncovered, its
fibres had a natural and even fresh-like appearance, but in a few
minutes after exposure to the air the freshly cut pieces became as
black as ink. Amongst the <i>débris</i> thrown up from a depth of 6 feet
below the log-pavement I picked up the larger portion of a broken
hammer-stone or polisher, which, from the worn appearance presented
by its fractured edges, must have been used subsequently to its
breakage. After considerable labour, when indeed the probability of
total discomfiture in reaching the bottom was freely talked of, our
most energetic foreman at last announced, after cutting through a
large flat trunk 14 inches thick, that underneath this he could find
no trace of further woodwork. The substance removed from below the
lowest logs consisted of a few twigs of hazel brushwood, embedded in
a dark, firm, but friable and somewhat peaty soil, which we concluded
to be the silt of the lake deposited before the foundations of the
crannog were laid. The depth of this solid mass of woodwork, measuring
from the surface of the log-pavement, was 9 feet 10 inches, or about
sixteen feet from the surface of the field. Amongst the very last
spadefuls pitched from this depth was found nearly one half of a
well-formed and polished ring made of shale, the external and internal
diameters of which were 3&frac12; and 2 inches respectively.

One portion of this moss was plaited in four plies and shaped like a
cue or pig-tail. It measured 17 inches long and 2 broad in the middle,
and tapered to a point.</p>

<h4>LOCHSPOUTS.</h4>

<p>Lochspouts is a small lake basin, about three miles to the
south-west of Maybole, somewhat oval in shape, and ensconced at
the base of hilly ground, which encompasses it, except towards
the north, where a narrow trap-dike runs across and cuts it off
from the open valley beyond. It is thus a natural dam, formed
in the face of a declivity, which, beyond the trap-ridge, still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
continues to slope rapidly downwards for a few hundred yards. No
outlet could therefore at any time exist, except along this barrier,
and an inspection of its present condition reveals several deep gashes
through which at one time the surplus water made its escape. Indeed,
some of the oldest inhabitants state that the name "Lochspouts" was
given to it because, in former times, during heavy floods, its waters
spouted across this ridge at different points. Within the recollection
of some of them an artificial cutting was made through the rocky
outlet, with the view of utilising its waters for a "walk-mill," an
operation which reduced the level of the lake about ten feet, and its
area to about two acres. A small island must have then appeared, but,
apparently, its nature was unsuspected; and so it remained till 1879,
when Mr. James Macfadzean recognised it as the site of an ancient
lake-dwelling. This singular and, when surrounded by primeval forests,
secluded little lake is now restored to its pristine dimensions; but
its water, instead of acting as a defence to an island fortress, or
propelling a primitive water-wheel, forms a reservoir for the domestic
supply of the town of Maybole. The necessary alterations entailed by
this transformation of the home of the crannog-builders&mdash;one of
which was to clear out the accumulated <i>débris</i> of many a jovial
feast in which, judging from the osseous remnants, pigs, oxen, and sheep
were no rarity-came very opportunely, as it enabled archæologists to
complete an investigation which was in the first instance initiated
through the liberality of Sir James Fergusson, the proprietor.</p>

<p>The remains of the crannog, in the form of a low circular mound
overgrown with coarse grass, lay at the north side of the lake,
near the middle portion of the rocky ridge, and so close to the
present margin that it formed a peninsula easily approached on <i>terra
firma</i>.</p>

<p>At first the only possible investigation was to remove the <i>débris</i>
down to the level of the water, and in the course of this operation
the following facts were ascertained:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) <i>Composition of the Mound.</i>&mdash;The surface of the mound was
composed of coarse grass, having tough matted roots spreading in a
thin layer of soil, which overlay about a foot and a half of stones
and rubbish, in which no relics were found. Below this the materials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
were of a very variable character; sometimes vegetable mould, stems of
grasses jointed like straw, and beds of heather and moss, which could
readily be separated into layers; and at other times heaps of ashes
and charcoal mixed with quantities of the shells of whelks, limpets,
and hazel-nuts. Intermingled with this heterogeneous mass were large
and small stones, broken bones, portions of deer-horns, and various
relics. Though several ash-heaps were distinctly discernible in the
vicinity of the hearths, no regular refuse-heap was met with; and the
broken bones and horns seemed to be dispersed over the general area of
the crannog.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Log-Pavement.</i>&mdash;About five feet deep (measuring from
the centre of the mound), and only a few inches above the level of
the surrounding water, there was exposed a rude, imperfect, and
irregularly shaped wooden pavement, formed of flattened oak-beams.
It covered only the central portion of the area contained within
the circle of piles, the rest being laid with branches and stems
of trees. On digging beneath this log-pavement large beams and
brushwood were generally encountered, but the voluminous gushing up
of water prevented reliable observations from being made regarding
these deeper structures. Occasionally ashes and charcoal were turned
up, and in one spot near the centre, and under my own inspection,
the men succeeded in digging downwards more than two feet below the
log-pavement before the water oozed up, in the course of which nothing
was turned out but pure ashes, bits of charcoal, and large quantities
of the shells of limpets and common whelks. At the bottom of this
hole were solid oak-beams, apparently flattened; but no sooner were
their surfaces exposed than the water rushed in and filled the trench.
These observations gave rise to the conjecture that this understratum
represented the accumulated <i>débris</i> of another, and, of course, an
older, period of human occupancy&mdash;a conjecture which also derived
some support from the fact that the surface of the log-pavement was on
a higher level than the tops of the encircling piles.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Hearths.</i>&mdash;Over the log-pavement, and a few yards
apart from each other, were three circular hearths, each about five
feet in diameter, formed of flat stones embedded in a bed of yellow
clay, and raised on a sort of pedestal composed of clay and stones,
to the extent of one to one-and-a-half foot. One of them, on being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
demolished, was found to have been built directly over a former
similarly constructed hearth, with an interval of about a foot. These
hearths were situated near the centre of the crannog, but on its
southern half&mdash;i.e. the semicircle farthest from the shore.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Gangway.</i>&mdash;On making a few trial trenches in the space
directly between the shore and the crannog in search of a gangway, we
could find no indications of woodwork. One day, however, my attention
was directed to a portion of the log-pavement which looked like a
wooden roadway projecting to the margin of the island, and pointing
in a north-western direction, towards a prominence in the trap-ridge.
Observing also, that, before the lake was lowered, this prominence
would be the nearest land to the crannog, it immediately struck me
that, if there was a gangway at all, it would be found along this
line. Hypothesis was right this time. The adhesive nature of the lake
sediment prevented the water from oozing up so quickly as it did on
the crannog, so that we were enabled to expose the woodwork several
feet below the level of the lake. Close to the crannog the upper
beams of the gangway were about three feet below the surface of the
grass; but as we neared the shore with the digging they became less
buried, and some of the uprights were found even projecting above the ground.</p>

<p>The general plan on which this gangway was constructed appeared to
be identical with that adopted by the crannog-builders of Lochlee.
Upright piles, singly and in groups, were placed in a zig-zag fashion,
between, and from which, the horizontal beams stretched, fan-like,
and so formed a sort of latticework, with empty lozenge-shaped spaces between.</p>

<p>From one of these holes, or meshes, some five feet below the
surface of the ground, a fine granite quern-stone was extracted. The
piles projected some two feet or more above the body of the gangway;
but there was no appearance of a subaqueous or superaqueous platform.
It would thus appear that its upper transverses were originally under
water&mdash;a remark equally applicable to the analogous remains at
Lochlee&mdash;but to what depth the wooden structures reached could
not be ascertained.</p>

<p><i>Further Excavations.</i>&mdash;In order to facilitate the projected
operations of clearing out the bed of the lake the Engineers of the
Maybole Waterworks caused the rocky outlet to be cut down to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
extent of 3 feet, which thus enabled them to remove a corresponding
section of the crannog. The result of this was to show, as was
conjectured from the facts ascertained in the previous explorations,
that there was, about 2&frac12; feet underneath the log-pavement
and its hearths already described, another habitable zone with its
log-pavement, mortised beams, etc., together with various relics of
human industry. It would appear that this was the original surface of
the crannog, as it corresponded with the surrounding stockades, some
of which were found in position. Others were seen among a heap of wood
collected from the excavated <i>débris</i>, amongst which were a few of the
ordinary transverses containing square-cut holes at their extremities.
One thick beam was deeply grooved and resembled the one found at
Lochlee. (See <b><a href="#Fig_138">Fig. 138</a></b>.) A few large flat planks,
having a round handle-like projection some 18 inches long at one end, had only
one square-cut hole, placed sometimes close to this handle, and at
other times at the opposite extremity. Another stout oak beam, 6 feet
long, contained a series of round holes about an inch in diameter,
and from 5 to 6 inches apart. The holes, which were on the broad side
of the beam, were about two inches in depth, but only penetrated
half through it, and from one of them a portion of a wooden pin was
extracted. This beam was in a fragmentary condition, being, like many
others, partially charred.</p>

<h4>RELICS.</h4>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;About a barrowful of hammer-stones and round
pebbles from 1 to 6 inches in diameter. Polishers and whetstones
also, numerous, the latter sometimes perforated for suspension. Three
portions of sandstone had each a circular perforation funnel-shaped
on both sides. Twelve quern stones, nearly all made of granite, of
which nine or ten are the upper stones. One spindle-whorl 1&frac34;
inch in diameter. Two polished discs, one being the segment of a
circle (<b><a href="#Fig_151">Fig. 151</a></b>), are supposed to have been used
as mirrors. An oval implement with two hollowed surfaces like the one represented
on <b><a href="#Fig_175">Fig. 175</a></b>; its length is 3&frac14; inches, breadth 2&#8541;,
and thickness 1 inch. The cup-shaped cavities are too large for mere
finger-marks. It is made of a hard grey trap rock and, though well
wrought all over, is not polished, nor does it exhibit any markings
such as are seen on the ordinary hammer-stones. Two flint scrapers,
one of which is here figured (<b><a href="#Fig_151">Fig. 151</a></b>).

tines of staghorn.</p>

<p><i>Wood.</i>&mdash;No specific object, except the stave of a vessel like
that of a milk cog, was found in the earlier explorations; but from

The arms of the cross as well as the surrounding circle are adorned with
a succession of incised circles alternating with short lines which
are supposed to have been intended for the reception of some kind of enamel.</p>

<h4>BUSTON.</h4>

<p>About half-way between Stewarton and Kilmaurs there is a
shallow basin of meadow-land which formerly, according to Blaeu's
Atlas, was the bed of a lake of considerable size called Loch Buston.
Within the recollection of the present generation this area was a
mossy bog in summer and a sheet of water in winter; and about
fifty years ago, when the present tenant, Mr. Robert Hay, came to
reside on the farm, there was a small mound situated about its
centre known as the <i>Swan Knowe</i>, on account of the number of
wild swans that formerly used to frequent it. When subsequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
engaged in reclaiming the bog, Mr. Hay states that as many as
thirteen cart-loads of timber were removed from the "Knowe," and
he distinctly remembers that, in consequence of the difficulty of
detaching some of the mortised beams, his father made the remark,
"there maun hae been dwellers here at ae time." He also states
that until the land was thoroughly redrained, a few years ago, there
was still a considerable mound to be seen; but at the beginning of
December, 1880, when I first visited the locality, there was hardly
any elevation to distinguish it from the surrounding field.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the havoc committed on the woodwork of the crannog
by a long exposure to atmospheric agencies before it finally sank
under the protective influence of the muddy water, and subsequently,
by the ruthless hands of the agriculturist, there still remained
sufficient materials to give one not only a general, but particular
and instructive notion of the mechanical principles on which the
island and its superincumbent structures were constructed. The general
results of the investigation may be categorically summed up as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The island was composed of a succession of layers of the trunks
and branches of trees, intermingled in some places with stones, turf,
etc.; and the whole mass was firmly knit together by means of upright
piles and horizontal beams arranged in three, and in one part four,
concentric circles.</p>

<p>2. The outer circle was intended more for protection than for
giving stability to the island, and in some parts, as at the east side
of the refuse-heap, the piles were closely set with their tops fixed
into a transverse beam after the manner of a stair-railing; while
those of the inner ones not only penetrated deeply and gave stability
to the island, but also were used as part of the wall of the central
building.</p>

<p>3. The area enclosed by the stockades was slightly oval in shape,
measuring 61 feet by 56, and rudely paved with wooden beams, many of
which were firmly fixed to the lower woodwork by stout wooden pegs as
well as to the encircling stockades, thus affording here and there,
as it were, <i>points d'appui</i>.</p>

<p>4. While there was one general hearth situated near the centre,
evidence of one or two fire-places elsewhere was quite conclusive. One
of these appeared to have been a smelting-furnace, as it contained
flat stones much stained with fire-marks and several masses of heavy slag.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 157</b>.&mdash;General View
of Crannog at Buston, looking northwards.</p>
</div>

<p>5. The entrance to the central area, which was determined by
the stumps of two massive door-posts, had a south-easterly aspect,
and in front of it there was a well-constructed wooden platform,
made of large oak planks supported on solid layers of wood, to
which they were pinned down.</p>

<p>6. Beyond this platform, and separated from it by a massive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
wooden railing which was continuous with the inner circle of
stockades, was the refuse-heap; and to the right a wooden pathway,
also protected on its outer side, led downwards and westwards to
the outer circle, where there appeared to have been a landing-stage.
(See <b><a href="#Fig_157">Figs. 157</a></b> and
<b><a href="#Fig_158">158</a></b>.) About twelve yards in advance of
this stage, and 4 feet from the surface of the field, a canoe was found
buried in the ancient mud of the lake (<b><a href="#Fig_159">Fig. 159</a></b>).</p>

Crannog, with the space between Inner and Second Circles of Piles

</div>

<p>This canoe was 22 feet long, 3 feet 6 inches broad at the
stern, widening to about four feet in the middle, and 1 foot 10
inches deep. It is remarkable as showing evidence of having been
repaired in two places by neatly fitting pieces of oak planking,
which were kept in position by transverse ribs and wooden pins.
The stern-piece was movable and fitted into a groove in the sides
of the boat. In the mud removed from its interior were a few
stones and portion of the skull of an ox.</p>

<p>The refuse-heap occupied an oblong position immediately in front
of the southern entrance. It measured some 30 feet long by 15 or 20
broad, and 5 feet deep alongside the above-mentioned railing. Here
nearly all the relics and some massive bones were found. These bones
were abundantly impregnated with the mineral vivianite, both in its
amorphous and crystalline condition, but the specimens of crystals
here were much inferior to those from Lochlee. The position of the
refuse-heap is seen in the immediate foreground of <b><a href="#Fig_157">Fig. 157</a></b>,
after the removal of its contents, as a pit partially occupied with water.

<h4>LIST OF RELICS.</h4>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Hammer-stones, polishers, and whetstones were
comparatively rare, only some half dozen being found. Among the latter
are fragments of a circular grindstone of fine red sandstone, showing
a diameter of about fifteen inches, and a large oblong smooth stone
perforated at one end.</p>

<p>Two blocks of sandstone with irregularly shaped cavities in each; a
third has a large cup-shaped cavity 5&frac12; inches in diameter and
2&frac12; inches deep, and on it are the marks of sharpening tools;
hence the cup is supposed to have been for holding water for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
facilitating the operation of sharpening. Another small fragment
has a neatly formed cup-shaped cavity. Two querns, both upper
stones; one is of the usual form, but the other is flat and more
like a modern millstone. It measures 18 inches across and the
central hole is 3 inches in diameter, but not funnel-shaped. For the
insertion of a handle there is a square-cut hole near the margin.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The two plates of gold seem originally to have formed the shell of an
early forgery of a coin, the oxidised core of which forms the contents of
the small tube. I thought at first that the substance might be resinous,
but I think it is some salt of copper. Some chemist could readily try this
[this has since been proved to be a salt of copper]. The coin itself belongs
to a class of trientes which have been found almost exclusively in England,
and are probably of Saxon origin. See Smith's "Coll. Ant.," vol. i. Pl. xxii.
9. Others were in the Bagshot Heath or Crondale find. See <i>Num. Chron.</i>,
vi. These probably belong to the sixth or seventh century. The find is of
value as helping to assign a date to the crannog." (B. 373, p. 231.)

<h4>AIRRIEOULLAND.</h4>

<p>"This crannog," writes Sir H. Maxwell, "is situated in the centre
of a peat moss, formerly a lake, and still in most summers and all
winters a quaking morass. Towards the centre of this moss, which is
about sixty acres in area, there is a circular enclosure 54 feet in
diameter, surrounded by a low wall. This is marked in the Ordnance
Survey maps as a fort; but no fort, in the ordinary acceptation, could
exist in the centre of what had been, at no very great distance of
time, a lake. Although no timbers were visible at the time of our
visit, the whole surface of the enclosure being green with grass,
and the surrounding moss covered with heather and bog plants, its
situation and character indicated its true nature to those experienced
in lake-dwellings, and a very slight excavation at once confirmed this
view. Beginning in the centre, the diggers exposed beneath the shallow
layer of vegetable soil the familiar features of a fascine-dwelling.
The only novel and most interesting feature in this crannog is the
surrounding fence, which, doubtless, was the usual mode of protecting
the huts or wigwams of the interior, but which in most crannogs
hitherto examined has been reduced by the action of the waves to a
shapeless mound or beach of small boulders. Here, however, owing to
flat flags having been used, the structure is perfect, surrounding
the entire islet to a height of about three feet. The depth of the
structure from the surface to the alluvial bed of the lake was 4 feet.
The lake bottom, into which the piles were driven, was soft peat, 7
feet deep. The moss around the island had grown since the structure
was made to the level of the island; but no deductions could be made
from that fact as to the age of the crannog, owing to the varying
rate of the growth of moss, and to the uncertainty as to when the
lake became filled up and moss ceased to grow. In the wonderfully
accurate and laborious map of Timothy Pont, published in 1672, the
present moss appears as a lake. Three days' labour sufficed to clear
out the greater part of the contents of the enclosure. The chief
relics disclosed, besides great quantities of bones of the usual
kind, including those of the goat and the roe-deer, were 17 small
beads of scarlet vitreous slag (<b><a href="#Fig_167">Fig. 167</a></b>), forming
a portion of a necklace; a rough shale ring, several excellent hammer and
grinding-stones, many quartz pebbles, which had been brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
for some unknown reason [sling-stones?] from the seashore, distant
about a mile; two broken crucibles (<b><a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a></b>),
a spinning-whorl of bone or horn. From a depth of three feet, flint flakes,
a small jet ring, a portion of a perforated jet ornament, and a remarkable
button-like object of bronze (<b><a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a></b>)." (B. 426, p. 113.)</p>

</div>

<p>Barhapple ("horse hill") Loch is a small lake some 500
yards long and 300 broad. Here, in 1880, in consequence of
drainage operations, a crannog became visible; but, owing to
the sponginess of its surface, no effective examination could
be carried out. The Earl of Stair, finding that during the
summer of 1884 the island had become much drier and harder,
made arrangements to have it thoroughly investigated. That the
increased firmness and consolidation of the island was due to
shrinkage was manifest from the fact that the upright piles,
which, when discovered, barely showed above the mud, now
projected 2 or 3 feet, and presented the appearance of a decayed
forest, with its stunted trunks still standing. It was also
observed that this shrinkage extended to all parts of the mossy
lake-bed; and, as a consequence of this, two double lines of
piles became visible in the long grass, one commencing at
the north and the other at the east shore of the lake. Both
lines were directed to the crannog, but stopped short of it by
some 20 or 30 yards. As to the structure of the crannog, it
was remarked that not only the uprights, but the horizontal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
beams were more methodically arranged, and of a stronger character
towards the margin. Here the uprights, many of which were made of
young trees of oak and ash, were firmly supported, especially in the
outer circle, by the intertwining among them of horizontal timbers.
On the north side, in a line with the piles of one of the gangways, a
distinct roadway, made of round beams, was traced, running from the
margin of the island to the dwelling-house, which was situated on
the east side, directly facing the other gangway. In this building
two fire-places were recognised, one a little north of the other,
and around them was a layer of charcoal from 5 to 12 inches thick,
containing the fag-ends of burnt beams, heather, and brushwood. From
among these embers some large prepared beams, also partially burnt,
were disinterred, two of which terminated in round tenons, having at a
little distance from their extremities a raised head or flange. From
these and other appearances it was inferred that the crannog had been
destroyed by a conflagration during a strong north-west gale, and as
there was no evidence of much accumulated <i>débris</i>, it was supposed
that this catastrophe occurred shortly after its erection. On making
a trench through the island it was found that below the burnt layer
there were beds of brushwood, ferns, etc., to a depth of 2 or 3 feet.
Beneath this lay the peaty substance of the lake-bottom, through which
an iron rod could be readily plunged to the extent of 4 feet, when
it struck some hard material, probably rock or silt of the original
glacial bottom.</p>

<p>Although this was the largest crannog hitherto found in
Scotland, being 157 yards in circumference, it was extremely poor
in relics, a fact which may be accounted for by the shortness of its
duration. The list of relics includes three shale rings (<b><a href="#Fig_169">Fig. 169</a></b>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
two of which were only fragments; half a canoe; a broken paddle,
and some worked pieces of wood.</p>

<h4>WHITE LOCH OF RAVENSTONE.</h4>

<p>This small loch, which is within a few minutes' walk of Ravenstone
Castle, is surrounded by a broad fringe of marsh and tall reeds.
Within this marshy area, and just skirting the water's edge on its
western side, there is a flat mound, some 80 feet square and 6 or 7
feet high, having on its surface the ruins of dry stone buildings.
These ruins consist of the foundations of walls, a foot or so high,
which clearly define the outline of a superstructure divided into
five rectangular compartments. This building did not occupy the whole
surface of the island, measuring only 55 feet by 47. The mound was
composed of large flags and boulders, on the top of which a few trees
found a suitable habitat, and no less than four of the compartments
were occupied each by the trunk of a venerable looking ash. Upon
investigating the base of the mound, piles and the projecting ends
of transverse beams were discovered in several places, and the
conjectured opinion that the entire mound was built over a substratum
of woodwork was conclusively proved by digging a central pit through
the only vacant compartment in the stone building. The result of this
was to reveal, at a depth of eight feet, a network of beams lying
transversely to each other, but to an undetermined depth.</p>

<p>The north or land side of the island showed signs of having been
roughly built up with large undressed flags, but the rest of its stony
perimeter was quite dilapidated. That the wooden island was inhabited
as a crannog, before its level was raised to its present height by the
addition of the enormous mass of stones and earth underlying its final
buildings, an idea suggested by the discovery of charcoal and the
shells of hazel-nuts over the woodwork, is a hypothesis that requires
further proofs before it can be accepted as well founded in fact.
(B. 426, p. 121.)</p>

<h4>FRIAR'S CARSE.</h4>

<p>The site of the crannog at Friar's Carse was a small pear-shaped
basin situated behind a wooded knoll, close to the Parliamentary road
to Dumfries, and in the midst of a well-cultivated but singularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
undulating district. By deepening the outlet of this
lake to the extent of two feet, a partial drainage was effected, which
reduced its area from 10 to 3 acres. It was only then (1878) that it
became generally known that a small bushy island near the middle of
the loch had been artificially constructed of oak-planks and trunks
of trees. As the weather was dry for some weeks previous to our
visit, and the water particularly low, we readily stepped on to the
island, over what appeared to have been the old bed of the lake, then
presenting a hard, crisp, and dried-up surface of aquatic plants. The
island was nearly circular in shape, measuring 80 by 70 feet, strongly
built, and surrounded by piles, some of which, however, were only
visible through the water. The log-pavement, which by this time had
been completely bared, was composed of parallel beams of oak, arranged
in groups, lying in various directions, and firmly united together by
the overlapping and sometimes mortising of their ends. At the margin
of the island there was a large quantity of stones, especially on its
north side&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the side towards the deepest portion of the lake.</p>

<p>Through these stones, which shelved under the water, a few heads
of the surrounding piles projected, some above and some below the
water. Mortised holes were here and there to be seen in the horizontal
beams, but there was no appearance of a breastwork surrounding the
wooden pavement&mdash;thus differing from the Lochlee crannog. In the
centre were a few ends of uprights, in rectangular rows, seemingly the
remains of partitions, one of which I traced for 40 feet in a straight line.</p>

<p>Upon inquiring where the rubbish removed from the island was
located, we were informed that it had been wheeled to the west
side of the crannog, and heaped up close to where we had stepped
on to the island. Here it lay for some days; but one morning, to
the great astonishment of the workmen, it was nowhere to be seen.
Upon examination, it turned out that the apparently dry bed of
the lake was a matted crust of mud and the roots of aquatic plants,
which, virtually floating over the water, suddenly gave way under
the accumulated weight and so the entire mass of the crannog
rubbish disappeared in the water beneath. With this singular,
but unfortunate, catastrophe terminated all prospects of finding
any more relics. It appears that there was not a great depth of
<i>débris</i> on the island, its maximum thickness being only 2 to 3
feet in the centre, where it formed a heap of ashes, charcoal, and
some broken bones. Here a few fragments of pottery were found.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<p>A circular portion of the log-pavement, near its centre, was
covered with small stones, as if to protect it from fire; some
remains of clay-flooring were observed in other parts of the island.</p>

</div>
<p>Regarding the deeper structures little can be said. Mr. Nelson
attempted to cut a hole through the timber, and, as far as the water
allowed the men to penetrate, he saw nothing but layer upon layer of
oak-beams lying transversely to each other. Judging, however, from
the solidity and firmness of the island, the great size of some of
the logs, and the depth of the surrounding water (still about twelve
feet a little to the west of the island), the total thickness of
this mass of timber cannot be less than 12 or 16 feet.</p>

the following reference to this island occurs:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Here was a cell dependent on the rich abbey of Melrose, which, at
the Reformation, was granted by the Commendator to the Laird of
Elliesland, a cadet of the Kirkpatricks of Closeburne. From whom it
passed to the Maxwells of Tinwald, and from them to the Barncleugh
family, also cadets of the Lords of Maxwell. From whom it went
to the Riddells, of Glenriddell, the present possessors. The old
refectory, or dining-room, had walls 8 feet thick, and the chimney
was 12 feet wide. This old building having become ruinous, was
pulled down in 1773, to make way for the present house.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Near the house was the Lough, which was the fishpond of the
friary. In the middle of which is a very curious artificial island,
founded upon large piles and planks of oak, where the monks lodged
their valuable effects when the English made an inroad into Strathnith."</p>

<p>The relics collected during the operations above recorded are
very few. A canoe 22 feet long, and a ponderous axe-hammer
head of whinstone (<b><a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a></b>) were found at some distance from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
the crannog. Two handles of jars with traces of a yellowish
glaze, some fragments of pottery ornamented with rows of pitted
impressions (<b><a href="#Fig_171">Fig. 171</a></b>), a circular stone polisher,
and an oval-shaped mass of vitreous paste, are all that were found on
the crannog itself.</p>

<h4>STONE LAKE-DWELLINGS AND OTHER ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS.</h4>

<p>But besides the wooden islands there are others, still extant in
several of our Scottish lakes, which appear to be composed entirely
of stones and earth irregularly heaped together. In the absence of
any historical knowledge as to their age there is no <i>prima facie</i>
reason why some of these should not be contemporary with the former,
as it cannot be assumed that the crannog-builders made wood a <i>sine
quâ non</i> in the structure of islands. There were, no doubt, certain
stagnant marshes and small lochs in which a wooden foundation was
essential for the construction of an island, owing to the softness and
yielding nature of the mud; but, on the other hand, there were others
with compact rocky or gravelly beds, in which any solid materials, as
stones, earth, turf, etc., would be equally applicable. The outlets of
the larger lakes, more especially such as were formed in glacial and
rock-cut basins, were more adapted for the latter, and as far as my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
observations have enabled me to form an opinion, these are the very
situations in which the lake stone-dwellings abound. Some of them are
mere shapeless cairns, without any indications of having been formerly
inhabited, while on others some remains of stone buildings are to
be seen. As to wooden huts or houses, had such structures ever been
erected on them, it is not likely that they could, for any length of
time, have resisted the decaying tendencies of atmospheric agencies,
so that all traces of them would have disappeared long ago.</p>

<p>The social or military exigencies that led people to construct
artificial islands would also lead them to take advantage of such
natural ones as would be found most suitable, and we may reasonably
infer that it is in the absence of the latter that the former would
be resorted to. The great and primary object of the island-builder
was the protection afforded by the surrounding lake or morass, the
securing of which has continued to be the ruling principle in the
erection of defensive works down to the Middle Ages, long after the
wooden islands ceased to be constructed. The transition from the
crannog to the massive mediæval castle, with its moat and drawbridge,
is but a stage in the progressive march of civilisation.</p>

<h4>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SCOTTISH LAKE-DWELLINGS.</h4>

<p>To these remarks on the structural details of a few typical
crannogs, as disclosed by systematic research, I subjoin a tabulated
list of all the sites hitherto recognised in Scotland, comprising
not only the artificial islands, whether of wood or other materials,
but also some natural ones known to have been artificially
strengthened, as well as a few examples of castles, etc., now
or formerly located in bogs or drained marshes.</p>

<h4>CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF RELICS.</h4>

<p>The great value, however, of the investigations of the
lake-dwellings, especially in the south-west of Scotland, depends on
the quantity and variety of the remains of human industry discovered
in and around their sites. It is from such fragmentary remains as
food refuse, stray ornaments, broken weapons, useless and worn-out
implements, and such-like waifs and strays of human occupancy, that
archæologists attempt to reconstruct the outlines of the social life
and organisation of the prehistoric past. To those who may wish to
occupy themselves with this problem these explorations have furnished,
as we have just seen, a vast collection of objects made of stone,
 bone, horn, wood, bronze, iron, and gold.</p>

<p>Among the stone objects are&mdash;querns, hammer-stones, whetstones,
so-called sling-stones, a few cup-marked stones (one surrounded
by concentric circles), spindle-whorls, flint flakes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
scrapers, a polished celt, a perforated axe-hammer head, portions of
two polished circular discs, and some oval implements with a wrought
hollowed surface on each side.</p>

<p>Bones and horns of deer were utilised in various ways and
manufactured into pins, needles, bodkins, awls, picks, toilet-combs,
knife-handles, etc. The combs are neatly formed of three or four flat
pieces kept in position by two transverse slips, one on each side, and
riveted together by iron rivets. They are frequently ornamented by a
series of incised circles, which are sometimes connected by a running
scroll, as in <b><a href="#Fig_174">Fig. 174</a></b>.</p>

<p>The wooden articles consist of bowls, ladles, mallets, hoes, clubs,
etc., together with a variety of other objects apparently intended for
agricultural purposes.</p>

<p>Implements and weapons of iron are numerous. Amongst the former
are gouges, chisels, knives, shears, saws, hatchets, awls, hammers,
a bridle-bit, the bolt of a padlock, and other objects of unknown
use. The weapons consist of leaf-shaped spear-heads, both socketed
and tanged, daggers, and arrow-heads resembling those of the crossbow
bolt.</p>

<p>The objects made of bronze are mostly of an ornamental character,
comprising:&mdash;harp-shaped fibulæ, circular and penannular
brooches, finger-rings, a spiral ornament, ornamented pins, one with
a ring top and another with a glass setting, a small key, and some
other articles of an indeterminate character. From Dowalton there
are basins or cauldrons of beaten bronze, some clouted and riveted;
one, presumably a Roman saucepan, has the name of the maker on the handle.</p>

<p>On the Buston crannog were found two handsome and massive spiral
finger-rings made of gold. One is plain with five and a half twists;
the other, besides an additional twist, has both ends ornamented by
a series of circular grooves. From the same place there is a curious
gold coin, of Saxon origin, and a forgery of the sixth or seventh century.</p>

<p>Pottery is represented by numerous fragments, some of which are
of so-called Samian ware, but the most of them are of vessels of
a glazed ware, while a few are of an archaic type. Several neatly
formed crucibles, containing traces of gold and slag, are also in
the collection.</p>

<p>Among miscellaneous objects are bracelets and beads made of
coloured and of variegated glass or vitreous paste; also some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
jet ornaments, one of which is a handsome pendant in the form of
an equal-armed cross, inscribed in a circle and having one surface
ornamented by a series of incised circles which contained the remains
of a yellow enamel. Dr. Joseph Anderson considers this a Christian
relic of a very early type. A smooth and flat piece of ashwood, with
peculiar spiral carvings on both sides, and a fringe-like apparatus
made of the long stems of a moss, are among the objects which have
excited the greatest curiosity. Regarding a finely polished conical
object made of rock-crystal found at Lochspouts, a reviewer in the
<i>Academy</i>, October 14th, writes:&mdash;"Is it a charm or can it
have formed the centre knob or boss in the binding of some richly
decorated breviary or gospel book? Crystals very similar, but oblong
in form&mdash;like a Brazil nut&mdash;may be seen in some of the rich
covers of books of early date, and a few that have been detached are
preserved in collections. One such object forms part of a crystal
necklace in the Ashmolean Museum, and another in private hands was
employed, not so very many years ago, in the West Riding of Yorkshire,
for the purpose of seeing spirits. If this relic be, indeed, a
book-boss, it makes it probable that the crannog was at one time
inhabited, or at least visited, by Christian missionaries." Dr. Joseph
Anderson has also pointed out that this object is extremely like a
"large circular rock crystal which forms the central ornament on the
inferior surface of the foot of the famous silver chalice, dug up at
the Rath of Reerasta, near Ardagh, county Limerick, Ireland, in 1868,
and now in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin. According to
the Earl of Dunraven, this most beautiful example of our ancient art
was executed either in the ninth or tenth century."
(See <i>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</i>, December 4th, 1882.)</p>

<p>From the respective reports of Professors Owen, Rolleston,
and Cleland, on a selection of osseous remains taken from the
lake-dwellings at Dowalton, Lochlee, and Buston, we can form a fair
idea of the food of the occupiers. The Celtic shorthorn ox, the
so-called goat-horned sheep, and a domestic breed of pigs were largely
consumed. The horse was only scantily used. The number of bones and
horns of the red-deer and roebuck showed that venison was by no means
a rare addition to the list of their dietary. Among birds, only the
goose has been identified, but this is no criterion of the extent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
their encroachment on the feathered tribe, as only the larger bones
were collected and reported on. To this bill of fare the occupiers of
Lochspouts crannog, being comparatively near the sea, added several
kinds of shell-fish. In all the lake-dwellings that have come under
my own observation the broken shells of hazel-nuts were in profuse abundance.</p>

<p>From the number of querns, and the great preponderance of the bones
of domestic over those of wild animals, it may be inferred that, for
subsistence, they depended more on the cultivation of the soil and the
rearing of cattle, sheep, and pigs, than on the ordinary produce of the chase.</p>

<p>Proofs of a prolonged but occasionally interrupted occupancy are
also manifested by the great accumulation of <i>débris</i> over the
wooden pavements, the size and contents of the kitchen-middens, and
the superimposed hearths.</p>

<p>Let us now look at the remarkable series of implements, weapons,
ornaments, and nondescript objects here presented to us, with the
view of abstracting from them some scraps of information regarding
their original owners. The fragments of Samian ware, bronze dishes,
harp-shaped fibulæ, and the large assortment of beads, bronze and
bone pins, bone combs, jet ornaments, etc., are so similar to the
class of remains found on the excavated sites of Romano-British towns,
that there can hardly be any doubt that Roman civilisation had come
in contact with the lake-dwellers. The Celtic element is, however,
strongly developed, not only in the general character of many of
the industrial implements of stone, bone, and iron, but also in the
style of art manifested in some of the ornamental objects included
in the collection. Thus the piece of ashwood with its carved spiral
patterns (<b><a href="#Fig_144">Figs. 144</a></b> and
<b><a href="#Fig_145">145</a></b>), the combs, especially the
one showing a series of concentric circles connected by a running
scroll design (<b><a href="#Fig_174">Fig. 174</a></b>), and some of
the bronze brooches and ornaments (<b><a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a></b>)
present a style of ornamentation which is
considered peculiar to Celtic art. The spiral finger-rings seem also
to have been of native origin, and the probability is that they were
manufactured where they were found, as several crucibles are amongst
the relics from the same lake-dwelling, one of which, from the fact
that it still contains particles of gold, proves that it had been
used in melting this metal. (B. 373, p. 236.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the forged gold coin is the only relic that can
with certainty be said to have emanated from a Saxon source&mdash;at
least, that cannot otherwise be accounted for.</p>

<p>But if from internal evidence a presumptive case is made out in
favour of the Celtic origin and occupation of these lake-dwellings, it
is greatly strengthened when we consider that the neighbouring Celtic
races, especially in Ireland, were in the habit of erecting similar
island abodes, while there is not a particle of evidence in favour of
the idea that such structures originated with the Roman conquerors of
Britain or its Saxon invaders.</p>

<p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 176</b>.&mdash;Bone Combs, for comparison with those from the Lake-Dwellings.</p>
</div>

<p>The resemblance between the remains found in the Scottish and
Irish lake-dwellings, as well as other antiquarian finds of Celtic
character, must also not be overlooked. Combs, similar in structure
and ornamentation to those from Buston, have been found in several of
the Irish crannogs, in the brochs and other antiquities of the north
of Scotland, and in many of the ruins of the Romano-British towns in
England. (See <b><a href="#Fig_105">Figs. 105</a></b>,
<b><a href="#Fig_108">108</a></b>, and <b><a href="#Fig_176">176</a></b>.) Iron
knives and shears, variegated beads of impure glass with grooves and
spiral marks, ornaments of jet and bronze, implements of stone, bone,
and horn, besides querns, whetstones, etc., are all common to Celtic
antiquities, wherever found.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>That many of these relics were the products of a refined
civilisation is not more remarkable than the unexpected and strangely
discordant circumstances in which they have been found. For this
reason it might be supposed that the crannogs were the headquarters of
thieves and robbers, where the proceeds of their marauding excursions
among the surrounding Roman provincials were stored up. The inferences
derived from a careful consideration of all the facts do not appear to
me to support this view, nor do they uphold another view, sometimes
propounded, viz. that they were fortified islands occupied by the
guardian soldiers of the people. Indeed, amongst the relics military
remains are only feebly represented by a few iron daggers and
spear-heads, one or two doubtful arrow-points, and a quantity of round
pebbles and so-called sling-stones. On the other hand, a very large
percentage of the articles consists of querns, implements and tools,
crucibles, various domestic utensils, etc., from which, not to mention
the great variety of ornaments, there can be no ambiguity as to the
testimony they afford of the peaceful prosecution of various arts and
industries by the lake-dwellers.</p>

<p>There is, in my opinion, only one hypothesis that can
satisfactorily account for all the facts and phenomena here adduced,
viz. that the lake-dwellings in the south-west of Scotland were
resorted to by the Celtic inhabitants as a means of protecting their
lives and movable property when, upon the frequent withdrawal of the
Roman soldiers from the district, they were left, single-handed, to
contend against the Angles on the east and the Picts and Scots on the
north. It is not likely that these provincials, so long accustomed to
the luxury and comforts of Roman civilisation, or their descendants in
the subsequent kingdom of Strathclyde, would become the assailants of
such fierce and lawless enemies, from whom, even if conquered, they
could derive no benefit. Hence their military tactics and operations
would assume more the character of defence than aggression, and in
order to defeat the object of the frequent and sudden inroads of
the northern tribes, which was to plunder the inhabitants rather
than to conquer the country, experience taught them the necessity of
being prepared for emergencies by having certain places of more than
ordinary security where they could deposit their wealth, or to which
they could retire as a last resource when hard pressed. These retreats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
might be caves, fortified camps, or inaccessible islands, but in
localities where no such natural strongholds existed the military
genius of the Celtic inhabitants, prompted perhaps by inherited
notions, led them to construct these wooden islands. From the final
departure of the Romans to the conquest of the kingdom of Strathclyde
by the Northumbrian Angles, a period of several centuries, this
unfortunate people had few intervals of peace, and with their complete
subjugation ended the special functions of the lake-dwellings as a
national system of protection. No doubt some of them, as well as caves
and such hiding-places, would continue to afford refuge to straggling
remnants of natives, rendered desperate by the relentless persecution
of their enemies; but ultimately all of them would fall into the hands
of their Saxon conquerors, when henceforth they would be allowed to
subside into mud or crumble into decay.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;ENGLISH LAKE-DWELLINGS.</h3>

<p>The discovery of lacustrine abodes south of the Scottish border,
though the examples are by no means so numerous or so prolific in
industrial remains as those of Scotland and Ireland, is, nevertheless,
of special interest on account of the intermediary position in which
England stands geographically to the areas of their earliest and
latest development in Europe. It will be noticed that some of the
recorded observations here reproduced were actually made before
antiquaries realised the importance of the subject; otherwise it is
impossible to conceive how such highly suggestive facts did not at
once lead to more definite information.</p>

<h4>THE MERES OF NORFOLK AND SUFFOLK.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Wretham Mere.</span>&mdash;Sir Charles F.
Bunbury, as early as 1856, noticed some appearances in a drained
<i>mere</i> near Wretham Hall which clearly point to being the remains
of a lake-dwelling. In a communication on the subject to the Geological
Society he says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Wretham Hall, the seat of W. Birch, Esq., is situated about six
miles north of Thetford, in that extensive tract of open sandy plains
which may be called upland in comparison with the fens, but of very
moderate <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg
456]</a></span> elevation above the sea-level as is shown by the
slow course of the streams flowing from it. About Wretham there are
several <i>meres</i> or small natural sheets of water without any outlet.
The one to which my attention was particularly directed by Mr. Birch
occupied about forty-eight acres, and was situated in a slight natural
depression, the ground sloping gently to it from all sides. The water
has been drawn off by machinery, for the purpose of making use, as
manure, of the black peaty mud which formed the bottom. This black
mud, which is in parts above twenty feet deep, is nothing else than a
soft, rotten, unconsolidated peat; or perhaps it should be described
as vegetable matter in a more complete state of decomposition than
ordinary peat, showing no distinct trace of vegetable structure.
Numerous horns of red deer have been found in this peaty mud,
generally (as I was informed) at 5 or 6 feet below the surface, seldom
deeper; many attached to the skull, others separate, and with the
appearance of having been shed naturally. What is most remarkable,
several of those which were found with the skulls attached had been
<i>sawn off</i> just above the brow antlers&mdash;not broken, but cut off
clean and smoothly, evidently by human agency. Some of the horns are
of large size, measuring 9 inches round immediately below the brow antler....</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Numerous posts of oak-wood, shaped and pointed by human art,
were found standing erect, entirely buried in the peat."</p>

<p>It appears that in 1851 a more remarkable "find" became visible
on draining another <i>mere</i> on this same estate, though the events
remained unrecorded till the years 1858 and 1862. The following
notice is compiled mainly and almost verbatim from Mr. Newton's
observations, which he states were directly obtained from Mr. Birch,
the proprietor:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
In this mere (West Mere) there was ordinarily about four feet of
water, and beneath it, about eight feet of soft black mud, partly
held in suspension and requiring to be removed in scoops. Near the
centre of the <i>mere</i>, lying below the black mud, was found a ring or
circular bank of fine white earth, sufficiently solid to allow Mr.
Birch to ride upon it without yielding to the weight of his pony.
Outside this ring the bottom of the <i>mere</i> was so soft and deep as to
be almost impassable until the mud was cleared away. The ring was some
twenty or thirty feet across, a foot wide at the top, and about four
feet in height. Not far from its inner circumference was a circular
hole, about four feet and a half in diameter and some six feet deeper
than the bottom of the <i>mere</i>. It was marked out by a circle of
stout stakes or small piles, apparently of alder, and it bore traces of
having been wattled. Between these two circles were the remains of a
wall, about two feet high and consequently lower than the top of the
ring, composed of flints packed together with marl or soft chalk. In
the same place was some earth of a bright blue colour, which, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
dried, crumbled to powder, and was not preserved, though traces were
still to be seen on the bones. In this interspace a still greater
number of bones was found, and also the remains of a much decayed
ladder, the sides and rounds of which were 15 inches apart. The stakes
were about four inches in diameter, very hard, as heavy as stone, and
of a dark grey colour. The fragments of the ladder, on the contrary,
were very rotten and light, but the remains of both, after being kept
some time, exfoliated and crumbled entirely to dust. In and around
this ring there lay a vast number of bones, of which no small portion
were the upper parts of the skulls of <i>Bos longifrons</i>, with the horn
cores attached, and many antlers of the red deer, either entire or in
fragments. All the former, excepting one unusually large example, had
a fracture the size of half-a-crown in the forehead (Babington). Of
the deer's antlers, some have certainly been shed in the due course of
nature; but others, on the contrary, have been separated from the head
by sawing. Of the other bones found in West Mere, and I am told there
were hundreds of them, most of the larger ones have been fractured at
one or other extremity, doubtless in order to extract the marrow they
contained. Another bone, and, as far as I can make out, the only one
found which presents this peculiarity, has been polished on one side;
but the reason why is not very obvious, unless it has served, as I
before suggested in the case of a similar specimen, for a skate. I
must add that no weapons or implements of metal which can be referred
to a period at all remote were brought to light in this or any of
the adjoining <i>meres</i>, but a great number of flint discs were found,
which, according to the description I have received (for unfortunately
none of them seem to have been preserved), must have closely resembled
those known to the Danish antiquaries as "Sling-Stones," from the
probable use made of them. (B. 46, p. 17.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barton Mere.</span>&mdash;In 1869 the Rev.
Harry Jones communicated a paper to the Suffolk Institute of
Archæology and Natural History "on the discovery of some supposed
vestiges of a pile-dwelling in Barton Mere, near Bury St. Edmund's,"
of which the following is an abstract:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Barton Mere is situated in a natural depression,
about four miles east of Bury St. Edmund's, and is mainly supplied by
springs, but at some seasons water flows into it from the high land on
the south, west, and north. When full it consists of about ten acres,
and averages 7 feet in depth. On the north side of the <i>mere</i> there
is a marly chalk, which, indeed, forms the main bottom of the <i>mere</i>,
being overlaid with a dark clay deposit from 1 to 5 feet deep. The
bottom layer of this deposit consists of a peaty coloured clay, so
tenacious as to keep its shape upon the potter's wheel. Most of the
bones and some fragments of pottery were found in this lower layer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
which varies in thickness from a few inches to about a foot and a
half. The <i>mere</i> is subject to occasional droughts. It has been dry
at least four times in the last forty years. About thirty-eight years
ago (1830), the <i>mere</i> being then dry, his grandfather, Mr. Quayle,
who lived at Barton Mere, dug out a quantity of stuff for the purpose
of laying it on the land. His digging resulted in a hole, which on two
succeeding occasions when the water was low, saved enough to keep some
of the fish alive, and provide a pond for the cattle. Bones and horns
of deer, and several spear-heads and rings of bronze, were reported to
have been found amidst six or seven stakes of wood <i>sticking up out of
the bottom and about as thick as the thin part of a man's leg</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The excavations conducted by Mr. Jones in 1867 were made by digging
several holes about three feet square. In the first two holes nothing
was found, but in the third an ox skull, broken bones, portions of
pointed implements of bone, and a bronze socketed spear-head were
disinterred. The latter, which was only 18 inches below the surface
and above the peaty clay, measured 13 inches long and two inches at
its widest part. The bones were of <i>Bos longifrons</i>, stag, pig, sheep
or goat, large dog or wolf, urus (<i>Bos primigenius</i>), and hare. These
were all in the peaty stratum. Beside, and along with the bones, were
found two or three flint flakes, cores, and rude flint implements.
There were several pieces of sandstone, burnt, with the mark of fire
plainly upon them, and divers calcined flints. Also a fragment of a
thin hand-made vessel. Besides the bones were several stags' antlers,
one or two of which were gnawed, probably by dogs, and another had
marks of some small-toothed animal, such as a rat. Others were cut by
human hands. One antler had a hole rudely worked in it at its broadest
part. There were also divers horns of the <i>Bos longifrons</i>, and,
curiously enough, one of the vertebræ of a Saurian. The latter was a
short distance off from the chief "find," and it was suggested that it
might have been used as a hammer by some of the natives who brought it
to the spot.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The portion of the "find" which caused most conjecture was,
however, a fabric of stake and wattle. "I found one stake 2&frac12;
inches thick, and 2 feet long, lying close over the spot where we
found most of the bones, but the fabric to which I now allude occurred
some twenty-eight inches below the surface of the deepest part of the
<i>mere</i>. The soil in the neighbourhood of it had been disturbed, so I
took a spud and trowel and worked the thing out with my own hand. It
resulted in an oval or egg-shaped structure of wattle, 5 feet 7 inches
long, and 3 feet 10 inches wide. There were 14 uprights, varying from
2 to 2&frac34; inches in thickness, at nearly equal distances apart.
Twigs and sticks were worked in these like the side of a very rough
basket. At first I thought it might have been a sunken coracle, but
on scooping out the clay with which it was filled, I found that the
wattle ceased about 14 inches down, and that the uprights were merely
stakes, from 21 to 27 inches long, driven originally into the chalk
marl. The bottom of this fabric was filled with broken flints which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
also found outside the lower part of the uprights and between them. The
flints must have been put in, the points and edges of the points of the
stakes being so sharp and clean that they could not have been driven
through the bed of flints."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The top of the wattle was on the level of the chalk marl, on which
most of the bones, fragments of pottery, etc., were strewn, and which
had been covered over to a depth of from 2 to 4&frac12; feet of dark
clay. No more stakes were found, but there occurred divers holes in
the chalk marl, some of them nearly in line, in which we could not
help thinking they might have once stood. Yet we found no remains of
wood in these holes." (B. 161, p. 31.)</p>

<p>Professor Boyd Dawkins, under the heading "Habitations in
Britain in the Bronze Age," writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Sometimes, for the sake of protection, houses were built upon piles
driven into a morass or bottom of a lake, as for example in Barton
Mere, near Bury St. Edmund's, where bronze spear-heads have been
discovered, one 13 inches long, among piles and large blocks of stone,
as in some of the lakes in Switzerland. Along with them were vast
quantities of the broken bones of the stag, roe, wild boar, and hare,
to which must also be added the urus, an animal proved to be wild by
its large bones, with strongly-marked ridges for the attachment of
muscles. The inhabitants also fed upon domestic animals&mdash;the
horse, short-horned ox, and domestic hog, and in all probability the
dog, the bones of the last-named animal being in the same fractured
state as those of the rest. Fragments of pottery were also found.
The accumulation may be inferred to belong to the late, rather than
the early, Bronze Age, from the discovery of a socketed spear-head.
This discovery is of considerable zoological value, since it proves
that the urus was living in Britain in a wild state as late as the
Bronze Age. It must, however, have been very rare, since this is the
only case of its occurrence at this period in Britain with which I am
acquainted." ("Early Man in Britain," p. 352.)</p>

<h4>LAKE-DWELLINGS IN THE FENLAND.</h4>

<p>The discovery of so many submarine dwellings in Holland and the
adjacent coasts of Germany which I have already described suggests
that similar remains might be found in the Fens and other low-lying
districts in Britain. The only reference, however, to such dwellings
with which I am acquainted is the following short notice by Mr.
Skertchly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I detected the remains of one (lake-dwelling) at Crowland in the
year 1870, during some excavations. The piles were of sallow planted
very closely together, upon these was laid brushwood, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
over this a layer of gravel. Immense quantities of bones, chiefly of
the Keltic shorthorn, were found, together with a few bone implements,
and a curious ornament of jet. Near Ely, stakes have been found in
the peat, but they do not seem to belong to a lake-dwelling."
("The Fenland Past and Present," by Miller and Skertchly. 1878.)</p>

<h4>PILE-STRUCTURES IN LONDON.</h4>

<p>On December 18th, 1866, Col. Lane Fox (now General Fox-Pitt-Rivers)
read a paper at the Anthropological Society entitled, "A Description
of certain Piles found near London Wall and Southwark, possibly the
Remains of Pile-Buildings."</p>

<p>The author commenced by observing that his attention was directed
to this locality by a short paragraph in the <i>Times</i> of the 20th
October, stating that upwards of twenty cart-loads of bones had been
dug out of the excavations which were being made for the foundations
of a wool warehouse near London Wall. The excavation commenced at 40
yards south of the street pavement: therefore, in all probability,
at about 70 or 80 yards from the site of the old wall. The area then
excavated was of an irregular oblong form, 61 yards in length, running
north and south, and 23 yards wide.</p>

<p>A section of the soil consisted of&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"1. Gravel similar to Thames ballast at a depth of 17 feet towards the
north, inclining to 22 feet towards the south end.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"2. Above this, peat of unequal thickness, varying from 7 to 9 feet.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"3. Modern remains of London earth composed of the accumulated
rubbish of the city."</p>

<p>Between the bottom of the peat and the highest spring tide
water-mark, as at present existing, there is a margin of 5 feet; but,
of course, this might have been different in Roman times.</p>

<p>Regarding the remains of piles in this locality the author makes
the following observations:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">
"Upon looking over the ground, my attention was at once attracted
by a number of piles, the decayed tops of which appeared above the
unexcavated portions of the peat, dotted here and there over the whole
of the space cleared. I noted down the positions of all that were
above ground at the time; and as the excavations continued during the
last two months, I have marked from time to time the positions of all
the others as they became exposed to view.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Commencing on the south, a row of them ran north and south on the
west side, to the right of these a curved row, as if forming part of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
ring. Higher up and running obliquely across the ground was a row
of piles, having a plank about an inch and a half thick and a foot
broad placed along the south face, as if binding the piles together.
To the left of these another row of piles ran east and west; to the
north-east again were several circular clusters of piles; these were
not in rings but grouped in clusters, and the piles were from eight to
sixteen inches apart. To the left of this another row of piles and a
plank two inches thick ran north and south. There were two other rows
north of this and several detached piles, but no doubt several towards
the north end had been removed before I arrived.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The piles averaged 6 to 8 inches square; others of smaller size measured
4 inches by 3; and one or two were as much as a foot square. They appeared
to be roughly cut, as if with an axe, and pointed square; there was
no trace of iron-shoeing on any of them, nor was there any appearance of
metal fastenings in its planks; they may have been tied to the piles, but
if so, the binding material had decayed.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
The grain of the wood was still visible in some of them, and they
appear to be of oak. The planks averaged from one to two inches thick.
The points of the piles were inserted from one to two feet in the
gravel, and were, for the most part, well preserved, but all the tops
had rotted off at about two feet above the gravel, which I conclude
must have been the surface of the ground, or of the water, at the time
these structures were in existence."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
These relics were exclusively found in the peat or middle stratum
(which varied from 7 to 9 feet in thickness), and "interspersed at
different levels from top to bottom throughout it."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Amongst the articles of human workmanship found in the peat the vast
majority are undoubtedly of the Roman era. Amongst them are quantities
of broken red Samian pottery, mostly plain, but some of it depicting
men and animals in relief; one specimen is stamped with the name of
Macrinus. All this pottery, in the opinion of Mr. Franks, to whom I
showed it, is of foreign manufacture. Other samples are of the kind
supposed to have been manufactured in the Upchurch Marshes in Kent,
and upon the site of St. Paul's Churchyard. Bronze and copper pins,
iron knives, iron and bronze stylus, tweezers, iron shears, a piece of
polished metal mirror so bright that you may see your face in it (this
Dr. Percy has pronounced to be of iron pyrites, white sulphuret of
iron without alloy), an iron double-edged hatchet, an iron implement,
apparently for dressing leather, a piece of bronze vessel, and other
bronze and iron implements, which, thanks to the preserving properties
of the peat, are all in excellent preservation. Amongst these were
also a quantity of leather soles of shoes or sandals, some apparently
much worn, and others, being thickly studded with hob-nails, may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
recognised as the caliga of the Roman legions; also a piece of tile
with the letters P. PR. BR. stamped upon it. Specimens of these are
on the table. The coins found are those of Nerva, Vespasian, Trajan,
Adrian, and Antoninus Pius....</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"In addition to the Roman relics above mentioned, others of ruder
construction remain to be described. They consist of what, in the
absence of any evidence respecting their uses, may be called handles
and points of bone. The former are composed of the metacarpal bones
of the red-deer and <i>Bos longifrons</i> cut through in the middle, and
roughly squared at the small end; the others, which are called by the
workmen spear-heads, are pointed at one end and hollowed out at the
other, as if to receive a shaft. Both Professor Owen and Mr. Blake
concur in thinking these implements may possibly have been formed
with flint, but I cannot ascertain that they were found at a lower
level than the Roman remains, nor have any flint implements, to my
knowledge, been found in the place. With them were also found the two
bone skates on the table; they are of the metacarpal bone of a small
horse or ass, one of which has been much used on the ice. Exactly
similar skates also of the metacarpal of the horse or ass have been
found in a tumulus of the Stone Period at Oosterend in Friesland; a
drawing of them is given in Lindenschmit's Catalogue of the Museum
at Mayence, etc. Others have also been found in Zeeland, at Utrecht,
and in Guelderland, and there is a specimen in the Museum at Hanover.
Professor Lindenschmit attributes all these to the Stone Period,
but the specimens on the table are evidently of the Iron Age, the
holes in the back having been formed for the insertion of an iron
staple. Similar skates have been found in the Thames, but they have
not hitherto been considered to date so early in England as in Roman times."</p>

<p class="blockquot"> Throughout the peat were several
kitchen-middens. One, deposited a foot and a half above the gravel,
is thus described:&mdash;"A layer of oyster and mussel shells about a
foot thick, with a filtration of carbonate of lime permeating through
the moss. In this kitchen-midden, Roman pottery and a Roman caliga
were found. Close by, the point of a pile, part of which is exhibited,
was found upright in the peat; it had been driven in in such a manner
that the point descends to the level of the kitchen-midden and no
farther. Now, as a pile, in order to obtain a holding, must have been
driven at least two feet in the ground, it is evident the peat must
have grown at least one foot above the summit of the kitchen-midden
before this pile was driven in."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
A second kitchen-midden is noted at a height of 3&frac12; feet
above the gravel, "composed of oyster, cockle, and mussel shells,
and periwinkles, with Roman pottery and bones of the goat and <i>Bos
longifrons</i>, etc., split lengthwise as if to extract the marrow, with
the skulls broken and the horns cut off. It is about a foot and a
half thick in the centre, thinning out towards the ends as a heap of
refuse would naturally do, and from 12 to 14 feet long; above this is
peat for about a foot or a foot and a half, and above the peat another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
kitchen-midden of the same kind as the preceding. Lastly, the soles of
shoes and Roman pottery of the same kind as that found lower down have
been taken out at the very top of the peat."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The distinguished investigator, being anxious to obtain further evidence
as to the thickness of the stratum in which the Roman remains were
found, states that he determined to watch the workmen for four or five
hours together during several successive days, while they dug from top to
bottom, commencing with the superficial earth, and passing through the
peat to the gravel below. The result was as follows:&mdash;"Roman red Samian
ware is found as high as 13 feet from the surface, but very rarely, and in
small quantities. At 15 feet it is frequently found, and from that depth
it increases in quantity till the gravel is reached at 18 to 21 feet. The
chief region of Roman remains is within two or three feet of the gravel."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Amongst the animal remains were, according to Professor Owen,
those "of the horse or ass, the red deer, the wild boar, the wild
goat (<i>bouquetin</i>), the dog, the <i>Bos longifrons</i>, and the roebuck.
The horns of the roebuck, I afterwards ascertained, were all found
at a higher level. These, and also the horse and goat, entered the
superficial earth, in which glazed pottery was also found; but the
remainder, including the red deer, wild boar, and <i>Bos longifrons</i>,
appeared, so far as my observations enabled me to judge, to be
confined to the peat."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Subsequently Mr. Carter Blake identified amongst these
osseous remains no less than four different kinds of the genus
<i>Bos</i>&mdash;viz. <i>primigenius</i>, <i>trochoceros</i>,
<i>longifrons</i>, and <i>frontosus</i>; as also a specimen
of the ibex of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Some human skulls were found in the lowest formation of the peat,
or immediately over the gravel. Along with these skulls only three
other human bones were found; but this, according to the author, might
not be the result of an oversight, as both the Celts and the Romans
were known to have practised decapitation.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The piles at the south end were identified as elm, the remainder
were oak (<i>Quercus robur</i>).</p>

<p>From the above carefully observed and recorded facts it will be
observed that in addition to the primary piles which were inserted
into the gravel there were others which did not penetrate so deeply,
one having been carefully noted which terminated in the peat a foot
and a half above the gravel. Facts precisely similar have been
observed in almost all pile-dwellings whether on land or in water,
showing that the elevations on which the platforms and huts were
reared were successively renewed. Another conclusion which we are
entitled to draw from the character of the relics and the conditions
in which they were found is that in the low-lying districts of London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
the system of pile-dwellings was known in Britain in post-Roman times.
Nor can it be said that this was a solitary instance, for similar
remains were found in New Southwark Street, in regard to which the
author writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The piles are of the same scantling, also of oak, but somewhat longer
than those of London Wall; the points are driven into the gravel; the
peat is three to four feet thick; large beams of the same size as the piles
have been laid across them horizontally, and Roman pottery is found
at all depths in the peat. Judging from the extent over which these piles
have been discovered, there can be little doubt that in digging for the
foundations of the many large warehouses and other buildings that are
now being built within this district the remains of early habitations are
constantly turning up and are destroyed without receiving attention."</p>

<p>As to the relics from these London pile-dwellings let me finally
observe, that, to a certain extent, both in character and surrounding
conditions they correspond with those from the Terp mounds in Holland
and North Germany, from which it is probable the earliest Anglo-Saxon
invaders hailed.</p>

<h4>CRANNOG IN LLANGORSE LAKE, NEAR BRECON, SOUTH WALES.</h4>

<p>Only one lake-dwelling has hitherto been recorded in Wales, viz.
that of Llangorse. The partial exploration to which it has been
subjected was undertaken by the Rev. Mr. Dumbleton, and the results
are recorded by him in the <i>Archæologia Cambrensis</i> for 1870 and 1872.
(B. 173.) The following extracts from these reports clearly show that
the island was entirely artificial and constructed after the manner
of the Scottish and Irish crannogs. Its structural features were well
seen in the surrounding stockades and log-floorings, while the heaps
of charcoal, remains of food-refuse, and other indications point to
a prolonged period of human occupancy. Mr. Dumbleton states that
until about seven years ago, when the lake was artificially lowered a
foot and a half, this island was not half its present size. He then
advances various evidences to show that formerly the level of the
water was still lower, when, therefore, the island would have been
larger than now. This opinion may be, and probably is, correct; but we
must remember that another factor has to be taken into account when
discussing the invariable submergence of these islands, viz. their own
pressure on a yielding lake sediment, together with the decay of the
brushwood and other organic materials which generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
formed their under strata. It is to be regretted that no relics
were found on this island, and I cannot help thinking that, in the
circumstances, a more careful search would have furnished some
scraps of the handiwork of its occupiers. From the description it is
clear that metal tools were used in manipulating the woodwork, but
otherwise, and in the absence of any historical notice, we have no
means of determining either the age of this singular lacustrine abode
or the social condition of its inhabitants.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Immediately beneath the southern spurs of the Black Mountains,
and in the hollow of the great geological fracture which parts that
chain from the Brecknockshire Beacons, is situated a sheet of water
now called the Lake of Llangorse. Its name was formerly Llyn Savathan,
or the lake of the sunken land. The area of water was once far more
extensive than it is now; and it has subsequently been, as I think,
considerably less than at present. A circuit of five miles will now
enclose it. The margin is flat and swampy, except on the north-east,
where the mountain descends upon the shore-line somewhat abruptly. The
depth, though by vulgar report vast and fearful, Leland has rather
overstated in assigning to it thirteen fathoms."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Within a bow-shot of the flat meadows on the north side there is
an island that would appear but little above the water, were it not
for some small trees and brushwood that have fastened upon it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Sailing by the island one day in 1867, I observed that the stones
which stand out on the south and east sides were strangely new
looking, and most unlike the water-worn, rounded fragments that on
the main shore have been exposed to the action of the waves; neither
did there seem to be any original rock-basis at all. It was, in fact,
nothing less than a huge heap of stones thrown into water two or three
feet in depth. Was this the key, I thought, to the old tradition of a
city in the lake? In the summer of last year, my brother, then living
in the neighbourhood, first discovered a row of piles or slabs; some
standing a few inches above water, for the lake was very low. We have
together made some investigations during the past month, the results
of which I will detail.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The island, as now above water, measures 90 yards in
circumference, its form being that of a square with the corners
rounded off. The highest part is nearly in the centre, and is 5 feet
above the water-level. The sides most exposed to weather, where also
the water is deepest, are composed of stones sloping into the water,
and extending to the distance of fifteen yards from the edge. Under
the water, however, they are not nearly so thickly strewn as above. It
is remarkable that on the leeward or northern side, about one quarter
of the island is almost destitute of stone protection with which the
greater part is covered. There is simply a surface of vegetable mould,
inclined towards the water. Neither in the water, which is there very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
shallow, are there more than a score of stones to be found on that
side. I must now speak of the piles. These are of two sorts, the most
obvious being either at the margin or within a few feet of it. Like
the stones, they are most numerous where the action of the storm would
be most felt, and upon the shallow side they disappear entirely. They
have been disposed in segments of circles, the stones being heaped
inside them, and thus saved from being torn away by the waves. These
piles (or rather slabs) are of cleft oak, and have been pointed, as it
seems, by cuts from a metal adze. We have counted about sixty. They
have been driven tightly into the shell-marl, to the depth of four
feet. There are also other piles, which are round, generally of soft
wood, and are found outside the present edge of the island. Several
are in water two feet deep, and are driven into the marl only twelve
or eighteen inches. These would have been quite powerless to confine
the stones, and were evidently for another purpose.... Is it not
likely that the island itself was central common ground? and that the
habitations were projected from its edge towards the water and were
supported by these thick round piles? Something like a ring of these
is found near the oak slabs before mentioned; and traces of a second
set are at the distance of twelve or fifteen yards, in water about
two feet deep. Between the two, small wood is found abundantly, a few
inches in the marl. At about ten yards from the shore, and in two feet
of water, there appear to be the actual remains of a sunken platform.
Three trunks of soft wood lie nearly parallel to one another. A 6
feet stem of oak, which I cannot account for, was with them. The top
of this we sawed off, as it exhibits the marks of some heavy cutting
instrument where, in modern days, a saw would have been used.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"I have to add to this subject the discovery of two much more
perfect platforms in a perplexing situation, namely, within the oak
slabs. They were composed of eight straight trunks, about six inches
in diameter, lying side by side. Their direction is from the centre to
the water; their ends, towards the shore, are thrust against the slab
piles; others are closed in one case by a transverse oak beam....</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The examination of the interior would, of course, unfold the
process of the construction. We therefore made several perpendicular
openings; and these invariably led us down to the shell-marl, showing
first a stratum of large, loose stones, with vegetable mould and
sand; next (about eighteen inches above the marl), peat, black and
compact; and beneath this, the remains of reeds and small wood. This
faggot-like wood presented itself abundantly all round the edges of
the island, and in the same relative position, namely, immediately
upon the soft marl; the object of it being, of course, to save the
stones from sinking.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"On digging through the before-mentioned low portion of the crannog
a different order of materials exhibited itself. As I said, the stones
are very few; the depth is 3 feet instead of 5; 18 inches of vegetable
mould; 6 inches of earth mixed thickly with charcoal; and 1 foot of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
peat, small wood or reeds. I may here say that this charcoal is found
under water, in very frequent small fragments, on this north-eastern
side; and is covered, not with marl or stones, but with sand. Bones
are found in numbers amongst the stones where the water is quite
shallow; every spadeful of marl, in some parts, would, as the water
dripped off, show one or more small bone fragments or teeth."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The osseous remains were more or less identified by Professors
Owen, Rolleston and Boyd Dawkins as belonging to <i>Bos longifrons</i>,
horse (small and large variety), red deer, and wild boar.</p>

<h4>LAKE-DWELLINGS IN BERKS, ETC.</h4>

<p>In 1878, Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S., communicated
to <i>Nature</i> a short notice of "English Lake-Dwellings and
Pile-Structures," in which, after drawing attention to the previously
published articles of General Lane Fox and Sir Charles Bunbury, he
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Since writing the above I have been informed that Mr. W. M. Wylie,
F.S.A., referred to this fact in <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xxxviii., in a
note to his excellent memoir on lake-dwellings. I can add, however,
that remains of <i>Cervus elaphus</i> (red deer), <i>C. dama</i>? (fallow deer),
<i>Ovis</i> (sheep), <i>Bos longifrons</i> (small ox), <i>Sus scrofa</i> (hog), and
<i>Canis</i> (dog), were found here, according to information given me by
the late C. B. Rose, F.G.S., of Swaffham, who also stated in a letter
dated August 11th, 1856, that in adjoining meres, or sites of ancient
meres, as at Saham, Towey, Carbrook, Old Buckenham, and Hargham,
cervine remains have been met with; thus at Saham and Towey, <i>Cervus
elaphus</i> (red deer); at Buckenham, <i>Bos</i> (ox) and <i>Cervus capreolus</i>
(roebuck); at Hargham, <i>Cervus tarandus</i> (reindeer).</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The occurrence of flint implements and flakes in great numbers on
the site of a drained lake between Sandhurst and Frimley, described
by Captain C. Cooper King in the <i>Journal of the Anthropological
Institute</i>, January, 1873, p. 365, etc., points also in all
probability to some kind of lake-dwelling, though timbers were
not discovered.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Lastly, the late Dr. S. Palmer, F.S.A., of Newbury, reported to
the Wiltshire Archæological Society in 1869 that oaken piles and
planks had been dug out of boggy ground on Cold Ash Common, near
Faircross Pond, not far from Hermitage, Berks." (B. 312, p. 424.)</p>

<p>The following is Dr. Palmer's notice of the pile-structures at
Cold Ash Common above referred to:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Recurring to the antiquities of the peat proper, I would refer to
the subject of lake-dwellings. I do not despair of finding them in our
neighbourhood, for I believe traces of them have been found near Cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
Ash, some such structure having been uncovered in digging bog-earth
for horticultural purposes. It was circular, measuring 30 feet across,
and the planks were 16 to 18 feet in length, roughly hewn, and with
beams crossing from side to side, and resting on the piles. There was
also a kind of causeway to it. It was on the borders of a morass, the
resort of wild fowl within the memory of man. The general appearance
of the valley at this place leads me to surmise that it was not long
since covered with water; there is still a pond in the centre. The
bog-earth had been carted away before I heard of the discovery, so
that I had no chance of examining it for animal or other remains."</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Transactions of the Newbury District Field
Club</i> adds the following note to the above extract:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Mr. Walter Money, F.S.A., has gathered some information about
this interesting relic of the past. It is situated on a part of what
was Cold Ash Common ... and has long been known as 'Wild Duck Pond;'
it is now an oval piece of water, not much more than 20 feet across,
surrounded by arable land.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"About thirty years ago, before the Common was enclosed, the
season being dry, the 'Wild Duck Pond' was cleared by Mr. Whiting, of
Longlane Gate, who thought the accumulated soil or mud might be useful
on the land. After the removal of the top soil, some rough timber
framing was met with, lying across the centre of the pit, forming, it
would seem, a rude platform. A space was cleared about ten feet deep,
where a heavy log of oak was found lying across from side to side.
This was not removed. The work was then abandoned; the soil taken out
being found to be of no use to the land. About thirteen years ago,
the excavation was repeated by Mr. Lancaster, the then tenant of this
part of Col. Loyd-Lindsay's property; but the investigation was not
pursued far, and the water having flowed into the digging, 'Wild Duck
Pond' was again restored nearly to its former condition."
(<i>Trans. of Newbury District Field Club</i>, vol. ii. p. 148.)</p>

<p>Remains suggestive of a pile-structure were also observed by
Mr. Dolby in 1870 in one of the ponds at Fence Wood, near
Hermitage. Here in digging they found "a sort of pyramidal
dwelling beneath the ground, the roof being covered with clay
about a foot thick. This roof was supported by a large piece of
timber, some twenty-six feet long, which they had got out.
There were causeways there also at a depth of fifteen or sixteen
feet. The water had long since rushed in and filled up the excavation,
so that nothing further is known of this place." (<i>Ibid.</i>, vol. i. p. 123.)

<h4>LAKE-DWELLINGS IN HOLDERNESS, COUNTY OF YORK.</h4>

<p>The discovery of lake-dwellings in Holderness is due to Mr. Thomas
Boynton, Bridlington (lately of Ulrome Grange), whose attention was
first directed to the subject in the spring of 1880. Previous to the
excavation of a great drainage scheme about the beginning of the
present century this district appears to have been intersected by a
series of sinuous and irregularly shaped lakes, whose surplus waters
partly found an outlet, not in the present artificially constructed
channels which convey them directly into the German Ocean, but in
quite a different direction, along a sluggish watercourse, still
extant, which falls into the Humber near Hull. That this latter was
in former times the natural drainage course of the entire waters of
Holderness is the opinion of Mr. Boynton and other geologists with
whom I had the pleasure of discussing the matter. Mr. G. W. Lamplugh
believes that the Gypsey Race&mdash;a stream which now enters the
sea at Bridlington&mdash;at some former period continued its course
through this chain of lakes and finally debouched by the same route
into the Humber. The natural causes which have effected this great
change in the hydrographical conditions of Holderness are to be found
in the steadily progressing encroachment of the sea on the land,
which here goes on at a very rapid rate. When the sea lay many miles
farther off, which undoubtedly was the case in former times, it is
supposed that the intervening land stood somewhat higher, and that
consequently Holderness was a complete water-basin, with its outlet
towards the Humber. But as the sea advanced, gradually undermining and
washing away the soft glacial deposits which here form its shores,
this natural basin became, as it were, tapped in the middle and so
allowed the waters of its upper reaches to escape directly into the
sea&mdash;a process precisely analogous to that by which its final
drainage was effected by human agencies.</p>

<p>Nor is this opinion based exclusively on geological considerations,
as we have positive historical proofs in the early annals of the
country that formerly towns existed whose sites are now far out
in the sea. Thus Mr. Poulson ("History of Holderness," p. 467)
states that "the writer of the chronicle of the Abbey of Meaux, in
lamenting the losses which the abbey had sustained, observes that
they received nearly £30 from the town of Hythe, in the parish of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
Skipsea, chiefly from the tithe of fish; but now, says he, 1396,
<i>the place is totally destroyed</i>&mdash;a proof that it was gone into
the sea before the commencement of the fifteenth century." The lake
of Withou, which is recorded as having paid tithe for its fish in
1288 (<i>Ibid.</i>, 468), is not only at present completely drained, but
more than half of its bed is washed away, and the sea beach, which
runs right across it, presents a most instructive section of its
sedimentary deposits and subsequent growth of peat.</p>

<p>From these remarks it will be seen that, in estimating the precise
physical conditions that prevailed when the lacustrine abodes I am now
about to describe were constructed, we have to deal with problems of
a somewhat discursive character, and which, consequently, lie beyond
the scope of this work. It is clear, however, that, previous to its
artificial drainage, the district was overspread with a succession
of shallow lakes and marshes, pre-eminently well adapted for the
construction of lake-dwellings. The lakes are now gone and instead
of them we have artificial drains winding along the lowest portions
of their former beds. It is along the steep banks of these sluggish
water-channels that Mr. Boynton has detected, in various places, piles
and transverse beams, which he justly considers to be the remains of
ancient lake-dwellings. Up to the present time indications of five
stations have been observed, which for facility of reference the
discoverer names as follows&mdash;(1) West Furze, (2) Round Hill,
(3) Barmston, (4) Gransmoor, and (5) Little Kelk.</p>

<p>These are situated at considerable intervals from each other,
varying from half a mile to two or three miles, and as they are deeply
buried their investigation entails a considerable amount of labour and
expense. It is only the stations at West Furze and Round Hill that
have as yet been subjected to anything like a systematic exploration.
A few years ago Mr. Boynton at his own expense carried out a series
of excavations at the former station by which its character has been
satisfactorily determined, and subsequently he has undertaken to
examine the second with a grant from the Society of Antiquaries; but
these works are not yet completed, and at present they are entirely
suspended owing to the volume of water in the drain.</p>

<p>I may state that I have on several occasions visited the locality
and so became practically conversant with the general features of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
these discoveries. Moreover, for the special object of this work, Mr.
Boynton has freely placed all the materials in his possession at my
disposal and given me permission to add to my notes the accompanying
illustrations of a few of the more interesting objects.</p>

<p><i>West Furze.</i>&mdash;This was the first discovered, and the
circumstances that led to the discovery are thus described by Mr.
Boynton (B. 373, p. 300):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"In the spring of the year 1880 the Commissioners of Beverley and
Barmston Drainage found it necessary to deepen one of these drains
(the branch called the Skipsea drain).</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"A short time after this was done I was walking in one of my fields
adjoining, and picked up some perforated bone implements. I shortly
afterwards had the earth, which had been excavated at this place,
turned over, and found more implements of the same class. Also two
made from the antlers of the red-deer, and a small piece of red ochre,
with several stones which bear traces of having been utilised.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"In the month of May, 1881, the water in the drain at that time
being very low, and having obtained the services of half a dozen men
accustomed to similar work, I had the water dammed, and dug through
peat to a bed of gravel, 9 feet 6 inches from the surface.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"We found three more perforated bone implements, all in the side
of the drain, and at the depth of 7 feet, also several stakes and
piles with remains of brushwood. I then determined, when opportunity
offered, to excavate in the field, and proceeded to do so in December
last (1881). We commenced by digging a trench parallel with the drain
and 60 feet in length. This trench and the drain formed two sides of a
square, running north and south."</p>

<p>Subsequently Mr. Boynton cleared out the entire enclosure thus
marked out by these primary trenches and found the whole of it to
be occupied with an artificial structure of wood like the so-called
fascines of Switzerland or the crannogs of Scotland and Ireland. The
depth of decayed brushwood was very considerable, and it was pierced
here and there with upright piles. At the margin these piles were
thicker, and in one place, the south-east corner, he states that
they met with great "numbers of stakes, with some brushwood, the
earth being a peaty marl." Further progress from this point is thus
described:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"When clear of the slope there is a decided layer of brushwood about
two feet thick, also studded with stakes, and along the inner side of the
south trench we found a number of piles from 5 to 7 inches in diameter,
in a line, and mostly upright. One of these we got out quite perfect. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
is of oak wood, 4 feet in length, 6 inches in diameter, and has
a forked top which has apparently been intended for carrying a
horizontal beam or support. The piles are about 4 feet apart. One had
given way and had been replaced.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"As the trench is not exactly in a line with the piles, several
are now left standing and partially exposed. In this portion of the
digging we found several bones of animals, a peculiar grinding-stone
of whinstone or granite, almost semicircular in shape, 12 inches
long by 7 broad, a flint core, a stone with the centre hollowed, a
hammer-stone, and two fragments of rude pottery.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Hazel nuts are numerous; several I have picked out appear to have
been opened by squirrels."</p>

<p>The drain appears to have intersected the woodwork, and as the
excavations were confined to one side, the exact dimensions of
the lake-dwelling cannot be stated. Its length was approximately
about 70 feet, and its breadth probably one-third less. On my first
inspection of the locality after these excavations had been completed
I was struck with the narrowness of the lacustrine area in which the
structure was reared. From the nature of the adjacent ground it was
readily seen that the lake widened very considerably both above and
below; but here it was so contracted that the woodwork appeared to
occupy the entire breadth of the waterway&mdash;a fact which suggested
to me the idea of its being a bridge or military stronghold. However,
on closer inspection I saw that the accumulation of rain-wash had
considerably encroached on the original bed of the lake, and I am
satisfied that there would be, in former times, sufficient space for
giving to the dwelling a complete insular character.</p>

<p>The following relics, now in the possession of Mr. Boynton,
were collected in the course of the investigations:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Horn and Bone.</i>&mdash;The perforated bone implements
(<a href="#Fig_176_a"><b>Fig. 176</b><i>a</i></a>, Nos. 1 and 2), of which not
less than eighteen were collected, are the most remarkable objects. They all
consist of the articulate extremities of the long bones of some large bovine
animals, with the exception of two, one of which was the thick end of a scapula
and the other a cervical vertebra. The latter was not manipulated, and
the reason it is here classified as an implement is that a portion of
a wooden handle, which had been inserted into the spinal aperture,
still remained. In this manner the vertebra became a formidable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
weapon, which, when used as a club or skull-cracker, could scarcely be
matched by any work of art. I am of opinion that all these perforated
bone implements were simply warlike weapons. Three handpicks, made
from the horns of the red deer&mdash;the brow antler forming the pick
and the body of the horn, stripped of its antlers, the handle. Also a
club, or broken pick, and several portions of worked tines.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 176</b><i>a.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Holderness.</span>
All <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Stone.</i>&mdash;Three hammer-stones of natural pebbles; two anvils,
one flat and circular and the other having a slight cavity on one
side; six polishers, or rubbers; two flint cores, and about 50
substantial-looking flakes. One flake was a good example of a knife,
and showed evidence of having been used; three other flakes were
secondarily chipped and converted into neat scrapers and a saw (No.
3).</p>

<p><i>Bronze and Jet.</i>&mdash;One bronze spear-head (No. 4), and a
fragment of a jet arm-band, like those from the Ayrshire crannogs.</p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Fragments of a coarse unornamented pottery were
found, out of which one vessel has been restored, having the following
dimensions:&mdash;11 inches wide at mouth; 12 inches in the widest,
a little below the mouth; and 7&frac12; at base. Height, 7&frac12; inches.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>About thirty yards distant from the lake-dwelling, in a peaty
hollow in the field, Mr. Boynton found pottery of a similar character.
It was buried about three feet in the peat. The depth of peat over the
lake-dwelling was somewhat more, being nowhere less than 4 feet.</p>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;No expert has as yet made a report on the
osseous remains, but they are believed to represent the following
animals:&mdash;<i>Bos longifrons</i> and <i>primigenius</i>, horse
(a small breed), dog or wolf, beaver, ox, pig, sheep or goat, deer,
otter (?), goose, and some small birds.</p>

<p>One well-formed human skull, with portion of an upper jaw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Round Hill.</span>&mdash;So far as the
excavation of this station has been prosecuted the woodwork appears to
have been precisely similar to the former, but the area occupied is
of larger dimensions. Mr. Boynton thinks that the piles here belong
to different periods of time, and a curious fact which he pointed out
to Canon Greenwell and myself seems to support this view. He showed
us the point of one pile which had penetrated and terminated in the
stump of another, from which he inferred that before the former had
been inserted the latter had already been in a state of decay. The
decayed brushwood had also a greater thickness than at West Furze. The
station has not, however, yielded many relics, the principal objects
being a small stone celt, portion of a perforated stone hammer, and
the half of a jet bracelet. The latter appears to be unique. It is of
a flattish form, and ornamented on its outer side by five prominent
ridges, running circularly. The marginal ridges are separated from the
three central ones by a wider interval, in which runs a smaller ridge
or bead. These ridges were evidently manipulated without the use of a
turning machine, as they are not perfectly uniform, though the artists
intention was to make them so.</p>

<p>In regard to the other three stations there are only indications
of their being of a similar character, such as piles and transverse
woodwork along the bottom and sides of the drain. At Barmston, a stone
axe, a perforated bone implement, like those from West Furze, and bits
of charcoal were found. At Gransmoor a very large quantity of broken
bones lay exposed in the bottom of the drain, amidst a profusion of
oak piles and beams, but among them no implements have been found.

<h3>IV.&mdash;GENERAL REMARKS ON THE LAKE-DWELLINGS OF<br />GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.</h3>

<p>Having placed before you, with a considerable amount of fullness,
certain details of the investigations of ancient lake-dwellings that
have been made within the British Isles during the last half
century, I proceed now to the discussion of some facts bearing
on the ultimate question of their origin and development. As
my conclusions are of a somewhat argumentative character, involving
the consideration of some collateral phenomena as well
as a critical analysis of the special materials derived from
archæological research, it will be advisable, in order to secure, as
far as possible, precision, at least in methods, to concentrate attention
on a few definite problems&mdash;convenient foci as it were for grouping
my observations. I propose accordingly to deal successively with
their structural peculiarities; their range in space and time, and
how far this range coincides with ethnography; and, finally, their
relation to analogous remains in Europe.</p>

<p>Except in a very few instances, which will be afterwards more
specially referred to, all the lake-dwellings hitherto examined
in Great Britain and Ireland were constructed on artificial
islands made generally of wood, but sometimes of stones and such
other materials as might be considered suitable. Although no
such instructive examples as those at Lochlee, Buston, etc., have
been recorded in Ireland, there can be no doubt that those of
the latter country were built on the same general principles.
Indeed, few of the writers on Irish crannogs have paid much
attention to the structure of the islands, and, beyond the mere
statement that they were stockaded, palisaded, or surrounded by
one or more circles of piles, they have supplied no explanation
of the attachments and proper function of the surrounding piles.
But though the purpose of the mortised beams does not appear
to have been at first well understood in Ireland, it is of importance
to observe that their existence has not been entirely overlooked.
Dr. Reeves, writing of a crannog in the county of Antrim, says:
"These piles were from 17 to 20 feet long, and from 6 to 8 inches
thick, driven into the bed of the lough, and projecting above
this bed about 5 or 6 feet. They were bound together at the top
by horizontal oak-beams, into which they were mortised, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
secured in the mortise by stout wooden pegs." (<i>Proc. R. I. A.</i>,
vol. vii. p. 155.)</p>

<p>Mr. G. H. Kinahan in a paper on the crannogs of Lough Rea thus
incidentally alludes to the subject:&mdash;"A little north-west of the
double row, in the old working, there is a part of a circle of piles;
and in another, a row of piles running nearly east and west. Mr.
Hemsworth of Danesfort, who spent many of his younger days boating on
the lake, and knows every part of it, informs me that on the upper end
of some of the upright piles there were the marks of where horizontal
beams were mortised on them. These seemed now to have disappeared, as
I did not remark them." (<i>Ibid.</i>, vol. viii. p. 417.)</p>

<p>These are by no means isolated observations on this point, and when
we consider how readily the exposed woodwork of an uninhabited crannog
would be destroyed, either by the hand of man or the natural processes
of decay, we need not wonder that it is only the stumps of the piles
and generally submerged portions of these singular structures that
remain to the present day.</p>

<p>The construction of a crannog must have been a gigantic operation
in those days, requiring in many cases the services of the whole
clan. Having fixed on a suitable locality&mdash;the topographical
requirements of which seemed to be a small mossy lake, with its margin
overgrown with weeds and grasses, and secluded amidst the thick meshes
of the primæval forests&mdash;the next consideration was the selection
of the materials for constructing the island. In a lake containing
soft and yielding sediment of decomposed vegetable matter, it is
manifest that any heavy substances, such as stones and earth, would
be totally inadmissible, owing to their weight, so that solid logs of
wood, provided there was an abundant supply at hand, would be the best
and cheapest material that could be used.</p>

<p>The general plan adopted was to make an island of stems of trees
and brushwood laid transversely, with which stones and earth were
mingled. This mass was pinned together, and surrounded by a series of
stockades, which were firmly united by intertwining branches, or, in
the more artistically constructed crannogs, by horizontal beams with
mortised holes to receive the uprights. These horizontal beams were
arranged in two ways. One set ran along the circumference and bound
together all the uprights in the same circle, while others took a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
radial direction and connected each circle together. Sometimes the
latter were long enough to embrace three circles. The external ends
of these radial beams were occasionally observed to be continuous
with additional strengthening materials, such as wooden props and
large stones, which, in some cases, appeared also to have acted as
a breakwater. The mechanical skill displayed in their structure was
specially directed to give stability to the island and to prevent
superincumbent pressure from causing the general mass to bulge outwards.</p>

<p>South of the Scottish border the remains of lake-dwellings are
too much decayed or imperfectly observed to furnish many reliable
data bearing on this subject. So far, however, as the evidence goes
it would appear that the artificial island in Llangorse and the
lacustrine dwellings in Holderness were true fascines; the former,
indeed, having all the appurtenances of the typical crannog.</p>

<p>The crannogs were made accessible by various means. Some had moles
or stone causeways, the existence of which, in some instances, became
known only upon the drainage of the lake. Hence it is conjectured that
these approaches might have been always submerged, and so supplied, on
emergencies, a secret means of communication with the shore. This idea
was suggested by the tortuous direction which many of them assumed, as
for example the causeway discovered in the Loch of Sanquhar which had
a zig-zag direction and so could only be waded by persons intimately
acquainted with its windings. Others were approached by a wooden
gangway, the evidence of which now consists only of the stumps of
a double row of piles. Others again were completely insulated and
accessible only by boats. One feature regarding some of the wooden
gangways deserves particular attention. Both at Lochlee and Lochspouts
the piles were found to be tightly embraced at their lower extremities
by a curiously constructed network of transverse beams. As the surface
of these elaborate structures was buried from 3 to 7 feet beneath
the lake-bed, my first impression was that they might have been
used, like the submerged stone causeways, as a concealed means of
communicating with the shore. To test this suggestion I had a special
excavation made along the line of a gangway at the Miller's Cairn in
Loch Dowalton. (B. 426, p. 102.) After digging through 3 feet of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
consolidated and hardened mud, we came upon a stratum of fine blue
clay, extremely tenacious, and little liable to displacement. The
pointed stakes of the gangway, which penetrated into this clay only a
few inches, here met with a firm resistance. It then occurred to me
that the ingeniously arranged wooden beams at Lochlee and Lochspouts
served merely the same end as the blue clay at the Millers Cairn,
and that they were to be found only in localities where there was
a great depth of mud incapable of affording a sufficient basis of
resistance to the piles. Such difficulties have been encountered by
the constructors of pile-dwellings in all countries; and it is curious
to note the variety of methods by which they were overcome. The Swiss
lake-dwellers sometimes surrounded the piles with heaps of stones
which now go under the name of <i>steinbergs</i>; at other times split
planks were laid on the soft mud into which the piles were mortised.
The former plan was adopted on rocky shores too hard for piles to be
driven in, and the latter where there was a great depth of soft mud,
as at Wollishofen and other stations adjacent to the town of Zürich.
In North Germany, as Persanzig, Aryssee, and other localities, the
log-house principle, which greatly economised the materials, was
adopted in the construction of the subaqueous foundations. It appears
to me that this was the principle adopted in the structure of the
great Irish crannog of Lagore, as Sir W. Wilde distinctly states that
it was "divided into separate compartments by septa or divisions that
intersected one another in different directions." It was in these
compartments, which were filled with bones and black mud, that the
antiquities were found; so that the crannog-dwellers must have used
them as kitchen-middens. Originally they contained only water, but
in the course of time they became filled with food refuse and other
<i>débris</i>. House-cleaning was thus reduced to a minimum, while the
laws of sanitation were not more violated than in the underground
cess-pools of many of our modern dwellings. A curious statement by
Wilde in regard to the disposal of bones at Lagore is that "the
remains of each species of animal were placed in separate divisions,
with but little intermixture with any others."</p>

<p>It may be also mentioned that the log-house structures
described by Pigorini as lining the inside of the surrounding
dyke in the terramara of Castione were perfectly analogous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
only in this case the compartments were filled with clay and
rubbish, so as to act better as <i>contraforte</i> to the clay wall.</p>

<p>Canoes are so invariably found associated with crannogs that their
discovery in lakes and bogs has been considered by Dr. Stuart as
an indication of the existence of the latter. This may be true in
some cases; but in others, such as Closeburn, Lochwinnoch, and Loch
Doon, three of the examples cited by him, it is more probable that
the canoes were used by the occupiers of the mediæval castles in the
vicinity of which they were found. From these and other instances
that have come under my notice I have come to the conclusion that
dug-out canoes do not indicate such great antiquity as is commonly
attributed to them, nor do they therefore necessarily carry us back to
prehistoric times.</p>

<p>There is no peculiarity in the structure or form of these dug-outs
which distinguishes their age or nationality. There is a good
collection of them in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy. Some have
pointed prows and square-cut sterns; others have both ends pointed;
some have cross bands, like ribs, left in the solid oak at regular
intervals, as if to strengthen the vessel; while others are uniformly
scooped out without any raised ridges. They vary much in size and
shape. The largest is thus referred to in the small handbook to the
Museum:&mdash;"Down the centre of the room extends the largest known
canoe, formed of a single tree. The remains measure 42 feet in length,
and the canoe was probably 45 feet long, by 4 to 5 feet wide, in its
original state. It was recovered from the bottom of Loch Owel, in West
Meath, and cut into eight sections for purposes of transport. There
is a curious arrangement of apertures in the bottom, apparently to
receive the ends of uprights supporting an elevating deck."</p>

<p>One of the canoes found at Lochlee, the remains of which
are still preserved in the Burns' Museum at Kilmarnock,
measured when disinterred 10 feet long, 2&frac12; broad, and 1&frac34; deep.
There were nine apertures in its bottom, arranged in two rows,
four on each side, with the odd one at the apex. These holes
were perfectly round, and exactly one inch in diameter; but
when the boat was found they were quite unobserved, being all
tightly plugged up, and it was only long afterwards that the
plugs, upon drying, dropped out and so revealed their existence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>

<p>During the summer of 1874 a canoe (<b><a href="#Fig_177">Fig. 177</a></b>) was
discovered in Loch Arthur, or Lotus Loch, in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright,
in the vicinity of a small artificial island, which is thus described
by Rev. James Gillespie:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_177" id="Fig_177"></a>
  <img src="images/i_520.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="98" />
  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 177</b>.&mdash;Forward half of the Canoe found in Loch Arthur.</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot">
"When fully exposed to view by the trench which was dug around it,
the canoe was seen to be of great size, ornately finished, and in a
fair state of preservation. It had been hollowed out of the trunk of
an oak, which must have been a patriarch of the forest, the extreme
length of the canoe bring 45 feet and the breadth at the stern 5 feet.
The boat gradually tapers from the stern to the prow, which ends in
a remarkable prolongation resembling the outstretched neck and head
of an animal. When excavated this portion of the canoe was entire. At
the neck of the figurehead there is a circular hole, about 5 inches
in diameter, from side to side. At the prow a small flight of steps
has been carved in the solid oak from the top to the bottom of the
canoe. The stern is square, and formed of a separate piece of wood,
inserted in a groove about an inch and a half from the extremity of the canoe.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Along the starboard side (which when found was in good
preservation, except near the stern) there could be traced seven holes
about three inches in diameter. The three front holes were nearly
perfect, but at the stern the side was so broken that only the lower
parts of the holes could be observed. They are about five feet apart,
and the front hole is about that distance from the prow&mdash;the last
being about seven feet from the stern. There are three holes pierced
through the bottom at irregular intervals."
(<i>Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.</i>, vol. xi. p. 21.)</p>

<p>A curious feature presented by some of these canoes was that
accidental defects had been repaired, and the method adopted in its
execution is worth noticing. The canoe found close to the Buston
crannog already described (<a href="#Page_428">page 428</a>), showed this
peculiarity in a marked degree. Another from the Loch of Canmor is thus
described by the Rev. James Wattie:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"On the 16th June, 1859, there was fished up from the bottom of the
loch, near the north shore, opposite to the Prison Island, a canoe
(<b><a href="#Fig_178">Fig. 178</a></b>) hollowed out of a single oak-tree, 22&frac12;
feet long, 3 feet 2 inches wide over the top at the stern, 2 feet 10
inches <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
in the middle, and 2 feet 9 inches at 6 feet from the
bow, which ended nearly in a point. The edges are thin and sharp, the
depth irregular&mdash;in one place 5 inches, the greatest 9 inches.
There are no seats, nor rollocks or places for oars; but there may
have been seats along the sides, secured by pins through holes still
in the bottom. There are two rents in the bottom, alongside of each
other, about eighteen feet long each; to remedy these, five bars
across had been mortised into the bottom outside, from 22 to 27 inches
long and 3 inches broad, except at the ends, where they were a kind of
dovetailed, and 4 inches broad. One of these bars still remains, and
is of very neat workmanship, and neatly mortised in. The other bars
are lost, but their places are quite distinct. They have been fastened
with pins, for which there are five pairs of holes through the bottom
of the canoe, at the opposite side, at a distance of from 18 to 20
inches, the bottom being flattish. There are also five pairs of larger
holes through the bottom, etc." (B. 94, p. 167.)</p>

<p>Exact parallels to all these have been found in the Continental
lake-dwellings. Of two found at Vingelz, Lake of Bienne, the largest
was 43&frac12; feet long, 4 feet 4 inches wide, and had 4 ribs left
in the solid. It had iron cramps also, apparently to strengthen it,
and belonged to the pre-Roman Iron Age. One at Cudrefin had also these
solid cross ribs. One of the best preserved was found a few years ago
at Vingrave (Lake of Bienne) covered with 2&frac12; feet of mud, and
is now deposited in the Museum of Neuveville. It is roughly made,
having thick sides and a square-cut stern, with a groove for a movable
stern-piece. From measurements lately taken by myself I found it to be
30&frac12; feet long, rather less than 3 feet wide, and its greatest
depth 1 foot. Its sides had four or five cuts along their margin,
apparently for the use of oars. (B. 392, p. 20.)</p>

<p>That the crannogs in Scotland and Ireland lingered on sufficiently
long to come within the borderland of history requires no great
amplification here. The references to crannogs in the Irish annals are
very numerous, extending over a period from the middle of the ninth to
the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In 1870 there was published in the <i>Journal of the Royal Historical
and Archæological Association of Ireland</i> (B. 171<i>a</i>) an account
of an unsuccessful attack on a crannog near Omagh, in the year 1566,
by an English army under the command of Deputy Lord Sydney.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
This document, which was copied by Dr. Caulfield from despatches in
the Public Record Office, London, gives a vivid description of the
methods adopted in the attack and defence. A kind of pontoon was
constructed on "floating barrels," which conveyed the attacking party
to the island; but they found it "so bearded with stakes and other
sharp wood, as it was not without extreme difficulty scaleable, and
so ramparted as if the hedge had been burned&mdash;for doing whereof
the fireworks failed&mdash;without a long time it was not to be digged
down. Yet some scaled to the top, whereof Edward Vaughan was one, who,
being pushed with a pike from the same, fell between the hedge and the
bridge, and being heavily armed&mdash;albeit he could swim perfect
well&mdash;was drowned, and two others hurt upon the rampart and drowned," etc.</p>

<p>That these island forts, however impregnable they might be
considered in previous ages, had ultimately to succumb before the
more modern resources of warfare, is shown by the following narrative
taken from the Calendar of State Papers of Ireland, vol. 156, p. 374:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"There was one Dualtagh O'Conner, a notorious traitor, that of all the
rest continued longest as an outlaw, of power to do mischief. He had
fortified himself very strongly after their manner in an island or
crannoge within Lough Lane, standing within the county of Roscommon
and on the borders of that country called Costelloghe. A few days
ago, as opportunity and time served me, I drew a force on the sudden
one night and laid siege to the island before day, and so continued
seven days, restraining them from sending any forth or receiving any
in, and in the meantime I had caused divers boats from Athlone and a
couple of great iron pieces to be brought against the island, and on
the seventh day we took the island, without hurt to any on our side,
save my brother John, who got a bullet-wound in the back. When our
men entered the island there was found within it 26 persons, whereof
7 were Dualtagh's sons and daughters; but himself and 18 others,
seeking to save themselves by swimming, and in their cot to recover
the wood next the shore, were for the most part drowned. Some report
that Dualtagh was drowned, but the truth is not known. It was scarce
daylight, and the weather was foggy when they betook themselves to
flight. The Irishry held that place as a thing invincible."&mdash;Sir
R. Bingham to Burghley, Dec. 16th, 1590.</p>

<p>In addition to the historical evidence we have that of the
relics found on many of these crannogs, which includes iron pots,
guns, leaden bullets, coins, etc. Thus associated with two crannogs
in Lough Annagh were an iron cuirass, matchlock guns, pistols,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
antique keys, spurs, various implements of iron, a bronze ladle,
bronze spear-head, etc. (B. 149, p. 156.)</p>

<p>To the literary researches of the late Dr. J. Robertson we are
indebted for equally explicit historical notices regarding the
Scottish crannogs:&mdash;"Among the more remarkable of the Scottish
crannogs is that in the Loch of Forfar, which bears the name of St.
Margaret, the Queen of King Malcolm Canmore, who died in 1097. It is
chiefly natural, but has been strengthened by piles and stones, and
the care taken to preserve this artificial barrier is attested by a
record of the year 1508. Another crannoge&mdash;that of Lochindorb, in
Moray&mdash;was visited by King Edward I. of England in 1303, about
which time it was fortified by a castle of such mark that, in 1336,
King Edward III. of England led an army to its relief through the
mountain passes of Athol and Badenoch. A third crannoge&mdash;that of
Loch Cannor or Kinord, in Aberdeenshire&mdash;appears in history in
1335, had King James IV. for its guest in 1506, and continued to be a
place of strength until 1648, when the Estates of Parliament ordered
its fortifications to be destroyed. It has an area of about an acre,
and owes little or nothing to art beyond a rampart of stones and a row
of piles. In the same lake there is another and much smaller crannoge,
which is wholly artificial. Forty years after the dismantling of the
crannoge of Loch Cannor, the crannoge of Loch-an-Eilan, in Strathspey,
is spoken of as 'useful to the country in times of troubles or wars,
for the people put in their goods and children here, and it is easily
defended.' Canoes hollowed out of the trunks of oaks have been found,
as well beside the Scotch as beside the Irish crannoges. Bronze
(brass) vessels, apparently for kitchen purposes (<b><a href="#Fig_179">Fig. 179</a></b>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
are also of frequent occurrence, but do not seem to be of a very
ancient type. Deers' horns, boars' tusks, and the bones of domestic
animals, have been discovered; and in one instance a stone-hammer, and
in another what seem to be pieces for some such game as draughts or
backgammon, have been dug up" (<b><a href="#Fig_180">Fig. 180</a></b>).</p>

</div>

<p>"Before the recent drainage of the Loch of Leys&mdash;or the Loch
of Banchory, as it was called of old&mdash;the loch covered about
140 acres, but, at some earlier date, had been four or five times as
large. It had one small island, long known to be artificial, oval in
shape, measuring nearly 200 feet in length by about 100 in breadth,
elevated about 10 feet above the bottom of the loch, and distant about
100 yards from the nearest point of the mainland. What was discovered
as to the structure of this islet will be best given in the words of
the gentleman, of whose estate it is a part, Sir James Horn Burnett,
of Crathes. 'Digging at the Loch of Leys renewed. Took out two oak
trees laid along the bottom of the lake, one 5 feet in circumference
and 9 feet long; the other shorter. It is plain that the foundation
of the island has been of oak and birch trees laid alternately, and
filled up with earth and stones. The bark was quite fresh on the
trees. The island is surrounded by oak piles which now project 2 or
3 feet above ground. They have evidently been driven in to protect
the island from the action of water.' Below the surface were found
the bones and antlers of a red deer of great size, kitchen vessels of
bronze (brass) (<b><a href="#Fig_181">Figs. 181</a></b>
and <b><a href="#Fig_182">182</a></b>), a millstone (taking
the place of the quern in the Irish crannogs), a small canoe, and a
rude, flat-bottomed boat about 9 feet long, made, as in Ireland and
Switzerland, from one piece of oak. The surface of the crannog was
occupied by a strong substantial building (<b><a href="#Fig_183">Fig. 183</a></b>). This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
has latterly been known by the name of the Castle of Leys, and
tradition, or conjecture, speaks of it as a fortalice, from which the
Wauchopes were driven during the Bruces' wars, adding that it was
the seat of the Burnetts until the middle of the sixteenth century,
when they built the present castle of Crathes. A grant of King Robert
I. to the ancestors of the Burnetts includes <i>lacum de Banchory cum
insula ejusdem</i>. The island again appears in record in the years
1619 and 1654 and 1664, under the name of 'The Isle of the Loch of Banchory.'"</p>

<p>That Scottish lake-dwellings were known by the same name,
<i>crannog</i>, as the Irish, Dr. Robertson adduces the following
extract from the Register of the Privy Council to show:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Instructions to Andro bischop of the Yllis, Andro lord Steuart of
Vchiltrie, and James lord of Bewlie, comptroller, etc.... That the
haill houssis of defence, strongholdis and <i>cranokis</i> in the Yllis
perteining to thame and their foirsaidis sal be delyverit to his
Maiestie and sic as his Heynes sall appoint to ressave the same to
be vsit at his Maiesty's pleasour, etc., 14 Aprilis, 1608."</p>

<p>While the comparative late occupancy of the crannogs in both
countries is, therefore, unquestionable, their early origin is
enveloped in the deepest mystery. Was the system an indigenous
invention&mdash;the result of circumscribed local exigencies&mdash;or
derived from foreign sources? and when was it founded or introduced?
are questions that have elicited responses of different characters.
Sir W. R. Wilde, undoubtedly one of the foremost authorities on
Irish crannogs, assigns them to the Iron Age. "Certainly," says
he, "the evidences derived from the antiquities found in ours, and
which are chiefly of iron, refer them to a much later period than
the Swiss; while we do not find any flint arrows or stone celts,
and but very few bronze weapons, in our crannogs. Moreover, we have
positive documentary evidence of the occupation of many of these
fortresses in the time of Elizabeth, and some even later." (B. 24,
p. 152.) Mr. G. H. Kinahan, on the other hand, thus formulates his
opinion in a short article contributed to Keller's book (B. 119, 2nd
ed., p. 654):&mdash;"Of the time when the crannogs were first built
there is no known record, but that they must have been inhabited
at an early period is evident, as antiquities belonging to the
Stone Age are found in them. Some were in use up to modern times,
Crannough Macknavin, county Galway, having been destroyed in
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1610, by the English,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
while Bally-na-huish Castle was inhabited fifty years ago. Some
crannogs seem to have been continuously occupied until they were
finally abandoned, while others were deserted for longer or shorter
periods. In Shore Island, Lough Rea, County Galway, there is a
lacustrine accumulation over 3 feet thick, marking the time that
elapsed between two occupations."</p>

<p>That objects supposed to be typical of the Stone and Bronze Ages
have been found on many of the Irish crannogs there can be no doubt
at all. For example, among the remains described by Mr. Shirley from
the crannogs of MacMahon's country are stone celts, arrow-heads of
flint and bronze, three looped celts of bronze, etc.; but these were
associated with many iron objects of comparatively modern manufacture,
such as a gun-barrel, pistol-lock, ploughshares of iron, parts of
harps, and spinning-wheels, etc., etc.</p>

<p>"The oldest article," writes Mr. Benn, "from the crannog at
Randalstown found, so far as I know, was a stone hatchet, rather of a
small size, but not remarkable or uncommon. The most recent, and the
only piece of coin I ever heard of, discovered in such a locality,
is a base coin of Philip and Mary." (B. 29, p. 88.) In the crannog
of Roughan Lake, the last retreat of Sir Phelim O'Neil, some bronze
spear-heads were found, along with a highly ornamented quern stone. On
the lowering of Lough Gur an island became visible which is said to
have been a crannog, and on it were found, among other
things, a remarkably fine bronze spear-head,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
having its socket ornamented with gold, a stone mould for spear-heads
(<b><a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a></b>), and some bones of the reindeer; but yet
it existed as a stronghold till 1599, when it was surrendered by the English to
the Earl of Desmond.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
The sword-blades figured by Wood-Martin (B. 444, pl. xxxvii.) as
coming from crannog sites at Toome Bar are undoubtedly characteristic
specimens of the Bronze Age weapons; but then the evidence that
they are crannog relics at all is so slender that for determinative
purposes they may be considered valueless. Moreover they were
associated with objects equally typical of all ages&mdash;from
palæolithic flints to mediæval silver ornaments. "All these flint
flakes are of the earliest type," says Mr. Day, who describes
this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg
488]</a></span> locality, "many closely resembling those found in
the 'drift' at Abbeville;" and the relics include flint cores, stone
and bronze objects, a "ring brooch, enamelled bead, and a silver
armlet." (B. 92, p. 227.) Similar remarks are equally applicable to
all the Scottish crannogs on which objects apparently belonging to
different ages have been found. A reviewer of my work on "Ancient
Scottish Lake-dwellings" (B. 373), in which I gave it as my opinion
that the Lochlee crannog must be assigned to post-Roman times, takes
exception to this opinion on the grounds that amongst the relics
are a polished stone celt of neolithic type, flint scrapers, which,
he says, "may be of the Bronze Age, but could hardly be considered
as post-Roman," and portions of the antlers of the reindeer, which,
according to him, "can hardly have ranged as far south at any period
later than the neolithic age." Had my reviewer read the remarks in my
book at page 147, regarding this polished greenstone hatchet, he would
hardly have selected it to prove that this crannog existed during
the neolithic age. My words are: "As many of the relics, if judged
independently of the rest and their surroundings, might be taken as
good representatives of the three so-called Ages of Stone, Bronze, and
Iron, it is but natural for the reader to inquire if superposition
has defined them by a corresponding relationship. On this point I
offer no dubious opinion. The polished stone celt (that referred to
by my reviewer) and an iron knife were found almost in juxtaposition
about the level of the lowest fire-place." The iron implements on
this crannog included hatchets, chisels, gouges, and a crosscut saw,
and the very lowest logs bore unmistakable evidence of having been
manipulated with sharp metal tools. The entire absence of cutting
instruments of bronze renders it more than probable that such tools
were made of iron, and were similar to those found on the crannog.
As for the conclusions educed from the presence of the horns of the
reindeer (hesitatingly identified by the late Professor Rolleston), it
is now actually proved that this animal was not extinct in Scotland
before the twelfth century. In the "Orkneyinga Saga"<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
it is stated that "every summer the Earls were wont to go over to
Caithness, and up into the forests, to hunt the red deer or the
reindeer." The recent discovery of its bones and horns in refuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
heaps in Caithness, and in many of the brochs in the north of Scotland,
amply proves that the reindeer was hunted and eaten by the Norsemen as
late as the above date.</p>

<p>Whatever explanation may be forthcoming as to the prevalence of
prehistoric relics on these crannogs, there is no possibility of
denying that the vast majority of them were not only inhabited,
but constructed during the Iron Age. Mr. Wakeman, in the most
carefully investigated of all the crannogs in Fermanagh, viz. that
at Drumdarragh, describes three periods of occupation; yet among the
relics corresponding to the earliest period were several iron objects,
one being "an animal's head in iron," which he considers might be the
leg of a pot. Nor am I aware that superposition has defined in any
clear instance the heterogeneous mixture of relics that usually turn
up on crannogs.</p>

<p>It must also be noticed that few, if any, of them can be classified
as exclusively belonging to the earlier ages, like those so numerously
recorded in Central Europe. Indeed, there are only two or three
which have any claim to such delimitation, viz. those in Coal-bog
(Kilnamaddo), in Drumkelin bog, county Donegal, and in Holderness. On
the two former sites were found the most perfect examples of log-huts
that have yet come to light, and as they were both deeply buried in
peat, 17 and 25 feet respectively, they undoubtedly point to some
antiquity. But the relics, which include a stone axe and some flint
objects, are too few to justify such a sweeping conclusion as that
these dwellings were constructed at a period when metal implements
were unknown in the country. At any rate, there can be no reasonable
doubt that the period of greatest development of the Scottish and
Irish lake-dwellings was during the Iron Age, and, at least, as far
posterior to Roman civilisation as that of the Swiss Pfahlbauten was
anterior to it.</p>

<p>In instituting an inquiry as to how far the geographical
distribution of crannogs coincides with that of the various
nationalities of the period, we arrive at some striking results.
Thus adopting Skene's division of the four kingdoms into which
Scotland was ultimately divided by the contending nationalities
of Picts, Scots, Angles, and Strathclyde Britons, after the final
withdrawal of the Romans, I find that of the fifty or sixty
crannogs proper none are located within the territories of the
Angles; ten and seven are respectively within the confines of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
the Picts and Scots; while all the rest are situated in the Scottish
portion of the ancient kingdom of Strathclyde. That they have not
been found in the south-eastern provinces of Scotland may be due
to the rarity of suitable lakes, or the want of proper research on
the part of antiquaries; but, as the matter actually stands, their
absence suggests the theory that these districts had been occupied by
a foreign element before Celtic civilisation gave such a prominence to
the lake-dwellings. It will be thus seen that in the early centuries
of the Christian era the distribution of crannogs in Scotland and
Ireland closely coincides with a well-defined area in which the
Celtic language was spoken. For proof that in those days this was
the language of the south-west of Scotland, I need only point to the
recent work of Sir Herbert Maxwell on the topography of Galloway.</p>

<p>But from an etymological analysis of the earliest topographical
nomenclature of Britain, it is inferred that, during still earlier
times, a much larger portion of Britain, if not the whole of it, was
under the sway of the Celts. Hence it becomes interesting to inquire
if, in these localities, from which Celtic influence was expelled,
there exist traces of lake-dwellings. In localities where the Celtic
races were never supplanted by foreigners, it would be strange indeed,
and altogether at variance with archæological experience, if the habit
of resorting to isolated and inaccessible islands for safety would
be all at once abandoned, whenever the greater security afforded by
stone buildings became known. Hence the persistence with which the
island forts continued in these Celtic regions. But in this wider
Celtic area, on the supposition that the Celts were the introducers
or founders of the system, we ought to find some vestiges of these
dwellings along the regions traversed by them before they became
isolated from their Continental brethren, and cooped up in the western
districts of Britain. This is precisely what the general researches
into British lake-dwellings have shown in the stray remnants of
them that have been found in Llangorse, Holderness, the <i>meres</i> of
Norfolk and Suffolk, Cold Ash Common, etc. All these, with perhaps the
exception of the pile-structures at London Wall, appear to be older
than the majority of the crannogs of Scotland and Ireland.</p>

<p>Taking all these facts into account, together with the distinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
statement made by Cæsar that the Britons were in the habit of making
use of wooden piles and marshes in their mode of entrenchments, I am
inclined to believe that we have here evidence of a widely distributed
custom which underlies the subsequent great development which the
lake-dwellings assumed in Scotland and Ireland. Moreover, I believe
it probable that the early Celts had got this knowledge from contact
with the inhabitants of the pile-villages in Central Europe. On this
hypothesis it would follow that the Celts had migrated into Britain
when these lacustrine abodes were in full vogue in Switzerland, and
that they retained their knowledge of the art long after it had fallen
into desuetude in Europe. Subsequent immigrants into Britain, such as
the Belgæ, Angles, etc., would cultivate new and improved methods of
defensive warfare; whilst the first Celtic invaders, still retaining
their primary ideas of civilisation, when harassed by enemies and
obliged to act on the defensive would have recourse to their inherited
system of protection, with such variations and improvements as better
implements and the topographical requirements of the country suggested
to them. It is as defenders, not as conquerors, that the Celts
constructed their lake-dwellings.</p>

<p>This hypothesis, which was first enunciated in my work on "Ancient
Scottish Lake-dwellings" as a mere conjecture, has elicited a
considerable diversity of opinion on the part of critics. In the
<i>Times</i> of October 4th, 1882, it is thus referred to:&mdash;"This
is pure theory, and is quite unnecessary to account for the facts: as
well might one argue a connection between the pile-dwellers of New
Guinea and Central Africa and those of the Swiss lakes." Sir John
Lubbock (<i>Nature</i>, December 24th, 1882) confesses that he is
disposed to doubt that there is any connection between the geographical
distribution of the Scottish lake-dwellings at present known and that
of the ancient Celts. On the other hand, another reviewer attempts
to defend it on the ground that "in the Swiss lake-dwellings of the
Iron Age there are indications, especially in the ornamentation of
the sword-sheaths and other articles, of a style of art which closely
corresponds to the style of decoration prevalent in the crannogs of
Scotland and Ireland (<i>Scotsman</i>, November 22nd, 1882).</p>

<p>The indications above alluded to in support of this hypothesis
as based on a comparison of the relics, will be more appropriately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
discussed in my next lecture, when I come to review the lake-dwellings
of the Iron Age in Central Europe. There are, however, one or two
objections urged on the other side&mdash;as, for example, the
difference of structure and late occupancy of the crannogs, as
compared with the Swiss lake-dwellings&mdash;that require now
to be shortly considered.</p>

<p>As to the supposed difference in structure, I need only refer
to the structural details of various fascine-dwellings, as in the
lakes of Fuschl, Schussenried, Niederwyl, Inkwyl, Wauwyl, etc., as a
sufficient proof of the resemblance between them and the Scottish and
Irish crannogs. It is true that the pile-dwellings were more numerous
on the Continent than the fascine structures, while the reverse is
the case in Scotland and Ireland&mdash;if indeed the former can be
said to have existed at all in these countries. That the pile system
was, however, known to the crannog-builders, and occasionally acted
upon, we are not devoid of some positive evidence. Mr. G. H. Kinahan
says that a few of the Irish crannogs were built on piles (B. 119,
2nd ed. p. 654), and instances an example in Loch Cimbe (now Loch
Hackett), county Galway, which was so frequently blown down that the
occupiers were obliged to convert it into an island, which they did
by adding boat-loads of stones to its site. One of the lake-dwellings
in Lough Mourne I concluded to have been a pile-dwelling
(<a href="#Page_386">see page 386</a>), and it was connected to the shore by
a wooden gangway. Mr. Burns Begg describes remains of a pile-dwelling in Loch
Leven as an "oblong wooden platform, raised above the water on piles, twelve
feet or upwards in height." (B. 460.)</p>

<p>Subsequently I had an opportunity of visiting the locality,
along with Mr. Burns Begg, and I am convinced these remains
could not have been an ordinary submerged crannog or artificial
island. The lake bottom is not soft and compressible, but, on the
contrary, very compact and quite incapable of yielding to any
great extent. The structures, even in the present reduced level
of the loch, are never less than 1 or 2 feet below the surface;
but as formerly there would have been 9 feet more of water over
them it is quite improbable that this amount of submergence
could be accounted for by the usual subsidence or compression
of the submerged materials.</p>

<p>Some of the examples of lake-dwellings recorded in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
such as those described by Sir Charles Bunbury and Dr. Palmer,
would appear also to have been pile-structures.</p>

<p>If, therefore, both principles were known among the
crannog-builders of the British Isles, why, it may be asked, did
they give a preference to the fascine structures? I have already
remarked that these structures on the Continent were confined to small
mossy lakes, which, owing to the yielding nature of their sediments
and peaty deposits, were unsuitable for pile-dwellings. In such
conditions, which are generally prevalent in Scotland and Ireland, the
wooden island supplied more readily, and perhaps with less labour, the
requisite stability for platforms in boggy lakes and marshes intended
for huts and other superstructures, especially when these platforms
were small and the islands sparsely placed.</p>

<p>The wide chronological interval which separates the crannogs from
the lake-dwellings of Central Europe is also supposed to militate
against the supposition of there being any causal connection between
them. But this gap is more apparent than real, as, when carefully
looked into, it will be found to have been bridged over by a closer
series of links than was hitherto imagined. Not only were there some
lake-dwellings in Switzerland during the Iron Age, but in several
instances Roman, Gallo-Roman and even Allemanish remains were found on
their sites, as in the lakes of Starnberg, Ueberlingen, Zürich, etc.
(<a href="#Page_543">See page 543</a>.) Among the antiquities collected on the
site of the dwellings in Lake Paladru were horseshoes, curry combs, and a variety
of other antiquities which, in the opinion of M. G. de Mortillet and
other archæologists, could not be accounted for as the products of any
civilisation prior to Carlovingian times. We have also seen that in
North Germany they existed at equally late times, having overlapped
considerably into the Slavish period; while the Terp-mounds in Holland
and other places were only superseded by the construction of the great
sea-dykes. It must also be remembered that the custom of constructing
lake-dwellings was not universally adopted in Europe. Their absence
in Northern Europe, Spain and Portugal, and other places cannot be
accounted for by a deficiency in the topographical and hydrographical
requirements for such structures. They appear to have spread from the
great central area of their first development in Europe in sporadic
fringes, but never extending beyond the limits to which the ordinary
waves of human intercourse and civilisation would likely reach.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking all these circumstances into consideration, I repeat that,
while we are justified in ascribing the remains of lake-dwellings,
so far as they are at present known within the British Isles, to a
Celtic source, I see no <i>prima facie</i> improbability, as regards their
structure and distribution in space and time, against the hypothesis
that the Celts derived their knowledge of this custom from the great
system of Central Europe, though founded and developed at a much
earlier period.</p>

<p>The only exception to the general statement that the Celts were
the sole constructors of lake-dwellings in Britain (without taking
into account the earlier vestiges of such structures in England from
which, owing to the scarcity of industrial remains, there is, as yet,
no ethnological evidence either way), is the discovery at London Wall
recorded by General Pitt-Rivers. I have already remarked (<a href="#Page_464">page 464</a>),
on the similarity of these remains to those from the Terp-mounds in
Friesland. Especially interesting are the two bone skates, made from
the metacarpals of the horse, recorded from the former, because such
implements are common in the latter. I do not agree with Lindenschmit
(<a href="#Page_462">page 462</a>) in assigning all these so-called skates to
the Stone period. On the contrary, they are mostly of post-Roman date. In
lake-dwellings they are very rarely met with, and only one is recorded
as coming from a station of the Stone Age, viz. Moosseedorf (<a href="#Page_75">page 75</a>).
The other localities from which examples have been recorded are
Persanzig (<a href="#Page_315">page 315</a>), Dabersee
(<a href="#Page_317">page 317</a>), Kownatken (<a href="#Page_328">page 328</a>),
Starnberg (B. 119, 2nd ed., p. 593), and a Terramara in Hungary
(<a href="#Page_167">page 167</a>).</p>

<p>Though the Anglo-Saxons, in coming from the mouth of the Elbe and
the low-lying districts between it and the Rhine, must have been
familiar with marine pile-structures, they do not appear to have
cultivated the system to any great extent after immigrating into
Britain. But this may be accounted for by the fact that very soon
they became the conquerors of the country. It is only for defence
that lake and marsh-dwellings have been resorted to.

<h2>Sixth Lecture.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE LAKE-DWELLERS OF EUROPE&mdash;<br />
THEIR CULTURE AND CIVILISATION.</span></h2>

<h3>I.&mdash;STONE AGE.</h3>

<p>In the summary of the remains of lake-dwellings which I have
brought under your notice in the previous lectures, you will have
observed that there was often a great diversity in the character of
the relics even in stations that were lying close to each other. From
the study of this feature alone we must conclude that some flourished
at a time when the use of metals was entirely unknown to their
inhabitants, as all tools and weapons recovered from the <i>débris</i> were
made of such materials as stone, bone, horn, etc. The substitution of
bronze for these materials marks a decided change in the culture and
civilisation of the lake-dwellers&mdash;a change which becomes further
modified by the introduction of iron. We have thus a great variety
of lake-dwellings, distinguishable from each other generally by the
character of their industrial remains, according to the particular
civilisation which prevailed at the period of their habitation, some
dating from the pure Stone Age, others from the Bronze Age, while
others again bear the imprint of various later civilisations, as
Roman, Celtic, Carlovingian, Slavish, etc. In dealing, therefore,
with lacustrine remains as a whole, we have to take into account not
only their distribution over a wide geographical area, but also their
continuance in various parts of Europe for a long period extending
from the Neolithic Age to the dawn of written history.</p>

<p>The outlying parts of this wide field, comprising more particularly
the lake-dwelling remains in North Germany and in Great Britain and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
Ireland, I have already sufficiently dealt with when treating of
their archæological details, so that it is unnecessary to bring them
again prominently forward. There remains, therefore, only the central
area of Europe, where they originally developed and so extensively
flourished during the Stone and Bronze Ages. To draw, from a general
criticism of the mass of recovered materials which I brought before
you in the first three lectures, some general notion of the culture
and civilisation which characterised their occupiers is therefore
the first and primary object of this lecture.</p>

<p>Though the famous three ages of Stone, Bronze, and Iron had been
established as a method of classification before lacustrine treasures
became known, I question if there is in the whole range of prehistoric
archæology any class of antiquities that gives greater support to
this remarkable chronological sequence, or throws more light on the
introduction of metals into Europe than those collected from the
lake-dwellings. The period of duration of the early pile-dwellings
in Central Europe entirely covers and overlaps that which witnessed
the introduction of the great art of metallurgy in Europe. While the
contents of graves and ceremonial burials are important in preserving
special products of the technical skill of a people, we have from some
of these lacustrine dwellings materials for reconstructing the entire
life history of their inhabitants, giving, as it were, a complete
picture of their arts, industries, luxuries, and amusements.</p>

<p>That many of these lake-villages, built as they were on wooden
platforms and constructed of combustible materials, were liable to
conflagrations, we can readily believe, and we have had conclusive
evidence that many of them came to an untimely end in this manner. It
is, indeed, to such catastrophes that we owe much of our information,
as the sudden interruption of busy life-scenes in such a manner and
especially when accompanied by circumstances that tended to preserve
the ruins from decay, has been the means of supplying us, as it were,
with a photographic picture of the habits, customs, and industries of
the people; and it requires only a sufficient number of such instances
to be able, from a comparative examination of the recovered relics, to
construct a fair scale of the progressive civilisation and culture of
the lake-dwellers. On the other hand, there are lacustrine villages
which have existed, through various ages, such as Nidau, but the
association of objects so widely separated in point of time in one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
place becomes misleading, especially if their relative ages cannot
be tested by superposition in the relic-bed&mdash;which can rarely
be the case in lacustrine investigations, as in the act of dredging
the relics are all jumbled together.</p>

<p>Professor Desor, observing that large quantities of pottery of
every description were found in certain localities, which could
not belong to one family, and that many of the bronze weapons and
implements were new and unused, suggested that the palafittes in
Lake Neuchâtel were merely magazines or shops, and not the ordinary
residences of the people. (B. 252, p. 3.) But this opinion has not
been adopted by Swiss archæologists; nor indeed is it at all justified
from a study of the character of the multifarious objects discovered
among their <i>débris</i>, which undoubtedly point to village life and
the exercise of social and domestic avocations on the spot. Dr.
Gross, in combating Desor's opinion, so far as founded on the unused
condition of many of the relics, remarks:&mdash;"Je possède dans ma
seule collection les tronçons de plus de dix épées réduites à l'état
fragmentaire par un long usage. Un grand nombre d'outils s'y montrent
altérés et modifiés par la même cause." (B. 392, p. xii.)</p>

<p>The settlements of the pure Stone Age are found only in a limited
area in Central Europe. Their greatest development has been in the
lakes bordering on both sides of the Alps, and it is especially
from the data there supplied that we become acquainted with their
characteristic features. This area may be more specifically defined
as including the lakes of Lombardy, Laibach, Bavaria, Switzerland,
and Savoy, with the exception perhaps of Lake Bourget&mdash;whose
palafittes appear to have been constructed exclusively in the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>One of the most striking facts, and one to which I invite
special attention, is the advanced state of the culture and social
organisations which prevailed amongst the earliest constructors
of these singular abodes. It is beyond doubt that, from the very
start, their inhabitants were acquainted with various industries,
especially weaving, which they sedulously practised; that they
reared the ordinary domesticated animals; and that they cultivated
flax, fruits, and various kinds of grain. For example, at Wangen
two varieties of wheat and the two-rowed barley were distinctly
recognised both in whole ears and in the separate grain, the latter
in quantities that could be measured in bushels. The stones of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
the grape, which Professor Heer (B. 123) somewhat hesitatingly
announced among the fruits from this station, may now be accepted
as genuine, as the grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) has recently been found
at Steckborn, another station of the pure Stone Age,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
and at Haltnau. (B. 462, p. 58.) Several varieties of well-made
cloth of flax, and mats of bast, were also found at Wangen. There is
preserved in the Museum of Fribourg a carbonised spindle from Lake
Morat, which shows fine threads still coiled round it, and Dr. Gross
figures a similar object from Locras. (B. 392.) Most antiquaries
are acquainted with the remarkable varieties of cloth, fringes,
nets, cords, and ropes brought to light by Messikommer from the very
lowest relic-bed at Robenhausen (<b><a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a></b>). Even
specimens of embroidery were found at the adjoining station of Irgenhausen.
(B. 126, Pl. xvi.) Remains of linen cloth, thread, nets, basket-work,
etc., have also been found in a great many other stations, as Vinelz,
Locras, Schaffis, Lagozza, Laibach, etc. But the absence of such
fragile and perishable relics from many other stations is not to be
taken as evidence that their inhabitants were unacquainted with such
industries; for it must be remembered that it is only when fabrics are
carbonised, or deposited in circumstances exceptionally favourable
to their preservation, that they are prevented from undergoing the
natural process of decay. Thus, at Schussenried, though there was no
actual cloth found, the impression of a well-woven fabric is clearly
seen on a consolidated mass of wheat&mdash;probably that of the sack
in which the grain had been stored&mdash;and at Laibach a similar
impression was observed on a fragment of pottery.</p>

<p>One of the stations in Moosseedorfsee which became completely
exposed in consequence of drainage operations, and was carefully
examined by the experienced archæologists Messrs. Jahn, Morlot, and
Uhlmann, yielded a large assortment of the osseous remains of animals,
amongst which the following were supposed to have been in a state of
domestication, viz.:&mdash;dog, sheep, goat, pig, and various kinds of
oxen. A few bones and teeth of the horse were also found, but these
might have belonged to the wild species, as it is not agreed, nor is
there any evidence, that this animal was domesticated till the Bronze
Age. The cultivated plants from this station were barley, two kinds
of wheat, pea, poppy, and flax. Among an assortment of its industrial
remains, now in the Bern Museum, are about a dozen celts of nephrite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
(one of jadeite), bits of cord, a wooden comb, a fish-hook made of
a boar's tusk, flint saws in their wooden handles, and fragments of
pottery, some of which are ornamented with nail-marks or perforations
round the rim. One piece of dark pottery (<b><a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a></b>,
No. 5) has a series of triangular bits of birch bark stuck on its surface
by means of asphalt. (B. 336, p. 37.) If any further evidence were
required to show the skill of the early lake-dwellers in the arts
of spinning and weaving, and the extent to which they followed
agricultural pursuits and the rearing of domestic animals, I have only
to call attention to the vast number of spindle-whorls, loom-weights,
etc., which are everywhere to be met with; the corn-crushers,
yokes for cattle (<b><a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a></b>, No. 1), field hoes,
picks, and other agricultural implements found on the sites of the earliest
settlements, as Robenhausen, Schaffis, Schussenried, etc.</p>

No. 1 = about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub>,  4 = 4⅓ feet long,
3 and 8 = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, and the rest = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p>That the potter's art was well known to, and practised by, the
early lake-dwellers hardly needs any demonstration when we look
at the mass of fragments, and even whole dishes, consisting of
bowls, plates, cups, jugs, spoons, and large vases, now tabulated
and stored in the various museums of lacustrine objects. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
dishes were made without a knowledge of the potter's wheel, and the
paste generally contained coarse sand or small pebbles; but a finer
kind was also used for the smaller vessels. Generally speaking they
are coarsely made in the earlier stations, having perforated knobs
instead of handles, yet occasional examples turn up which show that
handles were not unknown. The ornamentation consists of finger and
string marks, irregular scratchings with a pointed tool, raised knobs,
perforations round the rim, together with dots and lines in various
fantastic combinations. No two vessels exactly alike in style and
ornamentation have ever been found. The only approach that I have seen
is in the case of two vases, one from Bodmann (<b><a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a></b>,
No. 20), and the other from Schussenried (<b><a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a></b>,
No. 4), which certainly suggest that the vessels were made under the influence of
the same artist. In Lagozza and Polada artistic patterns were made
from the impressions of a small tube, probably a stiff straw or a
bone instrument, alternating with panels of crossed lines. In Laibach
great skill is exhibited, not only in the variety and elegance of the
vessels, but also in their ornamentation, which consists of various
figures, rectangles, crosses, rhombs, triangles, etc., the lines of
which are flanked with small pointed impressions. In the Mondsee a
similar taste for geometrical figures is displayed, and here the lines
are large and deeply cut so as to admit of the insertion into them of
a white substance which, on the originally black pottery, must have
had a striking effect. Associated, however, with these fantastically
ornamented dishes, both in Laibach and the Mondsee, are others of a
much inferior type.</p>

<p>To the food supply derived from agriculture, the rearing of
domestic animals, and the seeds and fruits of wild plants, they
added the produce of hunting and fishing; and the remains of
the weapons used in these pursuits are numerous. Arrow-points
of flint and sometimes of other minerals, as rock crystal and
jade, and of bone, are amongst the most common relics; and even
a few of the bows made of yew wood, notwithstanding their liability
to decay, have come to light, two from Robenhausen, and one
from each of the stations of Vinelz, Sutz, and Clairvaux.</p>

<p>It appears that the earlier arrow-points were of the triangular
type, with or without stems, and it is supposed that the addition
of barbs was an evolutionary process of improvement, and of
course of later date. Thus none of the arrows from Schaffis have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
barbs, but on the other hand Vinelz has supplied some beautiful
examples (<b><a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a></b>). The barbed forms are also prevalent
on the palafittes of Lake Varese and Polada, but they are entirely absent
from the stations in the Mondsee, Attersee, and Laibach Moor.</p>

<p>The discovery of some arrow-points with a portion of the wooden
shaft still attached has disclosed the fact that this union was
accomplished, at least in some instances, by means of an adhesive
material like asphalt. In the Neuchâtel district this material might,
indeed, be the natural product of this name, as it is so readily found
in the neighbouring <i>Val de Travers</i>. It is more probable, however,
that, as suggested by Dr. Dom, of Tübingen, it was the manufactured
product of birch-bark&mdash;a suggestion which explains the frequency
with which rolls of this material were found among the <i>débris</i> of
so many lake-dwellings. This adhesive material was used, not only for
fixing arrow-points and other implements in their handles, but also,
when mixed with charcoal, to give a black gloss or varnish to pottery.
Its discovery and application for such purposes in Polada, Mondsee,
Schussenried, and many of the Swiss stations of the Stone Age, as St.
Aubin, Locras, Moosseedorf, etc., proves that its use was prevalent
over the whole lake-dwelling area of the Stone Age.</p>

<p>Spear-heads and daggers were manufactured from flint, and specimens
of the latter have been found inserted into a wooden handle or
surrounded by a withe so as to give a better grip to the weapon. There
were also very effective weapons of this class made from the leg-bones
of deer and other animals, as well as from the tines of staghorns, etc.</p>

<p>For the purpose of carrying on the ordinary avocations of domestic
and social life the lake-dwellers were in possession of a varied
assortment of tools and implements, the precise function of some
of them, however, being difficult to determine. They had hatchets,
knives, saws, scrapers, borers, etc., of flint and other hard stones.
Cutting instruments were also made of horn, bone, and the tusks of the
wild boar, as well as an endless variety of pointers, chisels, etc.
With such tools they constructed wooden houses, scooped out canoes,
and shaped wood into various kinds of dishes, clubs, and handles.
The stone celt or axe-head, the most indispensable of all implements
to the Stone Age people, was mounted in a variety of ways. Most
frequently there was a casing of horn into which the axe was fixed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
and this casing was then fitted into a wooden handle (<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>,
Nos. 8 and 10). Sometimes the horn fixing had a <b>V</b>-shaped slit
in the opposite end from the hatchet (<b><a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a></b>, No. 13), which
fitted into a corresponding slit in a crooked handle (<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>,
Nos. 1, 13, and 14). When locked the instrument became a kind of adze,
the cutting edge transverse to the axis of the handle. This method Dr.
Gross thinks was more especially used in the Copper Age. At Wangen
horn fixings were rarely used, the hatchet being inserted into a split
cleft in a crooked branch. It is interesting to note that this method
was in use among the prehistoric salt-miners at Hallein, near Salzburg,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
and at Castione in Italy (<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 13).<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
The smaller axes and chisels, as well as a variety of flint
implements, were not infrequently inserted directly into suitable
portions of deer-horn, as shown in many of the accompanying
illustrations.</p>

<p>The perforated axe of stone or horn had simply a wooden handle
firmly fixed by a wedge inserted into a split at its end in the
perforation, an example of which, found at Schussenried, Mr. Frank
carefully preserves. Besides these there is a variety of objects of
horn and bone which might have been used as implements or weapons,
but mostly, I should say, for agricultural purposes, such as picks
(<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, Nos. 4 and 7), hammers, clubs, etc.
Some of the smaller bone implements were also inserted into handles, specimens
of which were particularly numerous at St. Aubin.</p>

<p>Flint saws were extremely abundant, and are to be found among the
remains of almost all the earlier stations, many of which still retain
their wooden or horn handles. Only in Polada has the compound and
double-handed saw been found (<b><a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a></b>, No. 12). It consists of
a casing of wood with four flints cemented into a groove along one of the edges.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>

Nos. 20 to 24 = <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>,
and the rest, except No. 25 = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
Another curious implement supposed to be a saw was found at Vinelz,
and is now in the Cantonal Museum at Berne (<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 17).
It consists of a massive handle of wood, evidently fashioned for the
hand, with three worked flints stuck in a row and kept in their place
by asphalt.</p>

<p>Among domestic utensils, in addition to pottery, are small cups
and boxes made of horn (Nos. 12 and 18). There are also spoons, pins,
needles, buttons, awls, knives, flax-combs, etc., of bone. Combs
for the hair were generally made of wood in the usual form (<b><a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a></b>,
No. 7). Another most ingenious method was by binding together
a series of prepared twigs with their ends folded one way, as seen in
<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 19.</p>

<p>Wooden dishes cut out of the solid, such as ladles, bowls, tubs,
etc., have been found in many stations, but especially at Robenhausen;
and there can be no doubt that similar vessels were in general use
among the early lake-dwellers.</p>

<p>I have already noticed the finding of fishing-nets at Robenhausen
and Vinelz, and a fish-hook ingeniously made from a boar's tusk.
Other fish-hooks were made of bone, as seen in the illustrations from
Bodmann, Wangen, and Bauschanze.</p>

<p>Nor were these early settlers insensible to the charms of personal
ornament. Shells (both recent and fossilised), coloured pebbles, the
teeth of carnivorous animals, ornamented pieces of bone and horn,
stone and clay beads, and even roundlets of the human skull, were
pierced for suspension, and worn either as pendants or necklaces
(Nos. 9, 11, and 20 to 24).</p>

<p>The skill displayed in the manufacture of the perforated stone axes
and hammers has often excited the astonishment of antiquaries; and
many of them thought that it was hardly possible to bore perfectly
round or oval holes through such hard materials without the use of
metal tools. Yet this was undoubtedly done, as we find not only bored
implements, but smoothly sawn portions, in the very earliest stations,
as, for example, Schaffis, Moosseedorf, Wangen, Robenhausen, etc. From
the former there are in the Berne Museum stone celts with a round hole
and one with an oval-shaped perforation. Quite as inexplicable are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
numerous fragments of stone, clearly indicating, from the parallel
grooving, that they were sawn off. Some of these pieces are by no
means small, and such as could be readily accounted for by the use
of flint saws. In the Museum of Zürich there is a large water-rolled
stone of serpentine, measuring 14 by 9 by 8 inches, which was dredged
up at Wollishofen, showing a cut 11 inches long and &#8541; inch deep.
One side of the cut was broken off, but the fragment was fortunately
also recovered and when made to fit in its place, which it does to
a nicety, the maximum breadth of the cut can be readily ascertained
to be &#8540; of an inch. The sides of this cut are finely striated with
parallel grooves, which are not exactly straight, but bent slightly
downwards in the middle. Before the sawing was begun there are clear
indications of a superficial groove having been made by chipping,
evidently with the intention of guiding the saw in the initiatory
stages of the process. What could this saw have been made of? I do not
think that with a flint implement this cut could have been made. It is
as regular as that from a modern steel instrument. It is now supposed
that the sawing of stones was performed with a thin wooden board and
some dry sand. The late Dr. Keller experimented with these simple
means, and found that they were quite sufficient for the purpose. He
also practically proved that in the same way, with a wooden tube set
in rapid motion round its axis, he could easily bore a hole in the
hardest stone. (B. 336, p. 49.) Anyone visiting the Museum in Zürich
may practically test the efficacy of these processes for himself, and
the obliging custodian delights in showing the method of working. Soft
wood is found to be better than hard, as the former takes up more of
the particles of the sand, which act like fine teeth in grinding the
stone. That tubes of some kind were used for boring stones by the
lake-dwellers is demonstrated by the finding of hundreds of round
cores, the result of boring on this principle, as well as, sometimes,
implements with the boring begun but incompleted, showing the round
core still in the hole as shown in <b><a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a></b>,
No. 6. In the Zürich Museum there is also a staghorn hammer from Robenhausen
with a partially bored hole having a core in its centre, thus proving that
horns were also manipulated in the same way (<b><a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a></b>, No. 12).</p>

<p>No problem has for many years puzzled archæologists more
than the effort to account for the finding, from time to time in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
various parts of Europe, of those remarkably elegant implements made
from the mineral substance commonly known as jade. Hitherto they have
been generally found isolated in the soil or in graves of the Stone
Age, such as the dolmens of Brittany. The favourite theory, seeing
that no local habitat could be assigned to this mineral, was that
these implements were imported by the original neolithic people, who
were supposed to have migrated westwards from the plains of Northern
India. The discovery of a large number of celts and small chisels
in the lake-dwellings, together with a few other objects made of
nephrite, jadeite, and chloromelanite, has reopened the problem as to
their origin, with the result, however, of making the controversial
flame burn brisker than ever. Independent of the lake-dwelling finds,
the number of jade objects now known in Europe may be roughly stated
at 200, about the half of which come from some 44 departments of
France. Of the remaining 100 about 80 are from Western Germany, the
rest being assigned to various localities in Italy,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Austria, and Greece. According to the opinions of competent
mineralogists the vast majority of those from Western Europe are made
of jadeite and chloromelanite, the number made of the former being
slightly in excess of the latter. In the French group there is only
one of nephrite, from the vicinity of Rheims, and in the German group
three or four, found in Baden and Bavaria. Mr. A. B. Meyer states
that, with the exception of one from Posen, all the German examples
were found to the west of the Elbe.</p>

<p>In appearance, nephrite, jadeite, and chloromelanite closely
resemble each other, and, owing to considerable variations in the
colour to which they are all more or less liable, it is difficult to
distinguish them by the unaided eye. Generally speaking nephrite has a
somewhat soapy feel, with a lighter and more transparent tint of green
than jadeite, while chloromelanite is darker and less transparent than
either. According to Meyer their specific gravity is:&mdash;nephrite
2·9 to 3·2, jadeite 3·3, and chloromelanite 3·4 to 3·6. From the
large number of implements, especially hatchets, small chisels, and
sometimes knives (<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 28)&mdash;rarely
arrow-points and ornaments&mdash;found in almost all the lake-dwelling stations
of the Stone Age, it would appear that they were greatly admired and much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
sought after by the inhabitants of these settlements. Dr. Gross thinks
they were in greatest abundance in those stations which flourished in
the period immediately preceding that of the introduction of metals,
and that after this event they disappear altogether. (B. 392, p. 10.)</p>

<p>From Lake Constance the number of jade implements now considerably
exceeds 1,000, as may be verified by an inspection of the museums
in the neighbourhood. One station alone, Maurach, has supplied 349
tolerably well, and 141 badly, made implements, and no less than 154
chips and sawn portions varying from the size of a finger-nail to a
few inches. (B. 378, p. 78.) Similar chips have also been occasionally
met with in other stations. This at once settles one important
point, viz. that the lake-dwellers were in actual possession of the
raw material, which they worked on the spot. Although most of the
settlements in Lake Constance have yielded more or less specimens,
there is none that even approaches Maurach in point of numbers, the
next highest being Unter-Uhldingen, Immenstadt, and Sipplingen, from
each of which two or three score have been collected. In moving
eastwards towards the Danubian valley they become much rarer. Thus
Schussenried has yielded only one (jadeite), Olzenreuthe seven (all
nephrite), Starnbergersee two (nephrite), Laibach one (nephrite). Only
one (jadeite) is recorded from the Mondsee, and none from
the Attersee. According to Fischer<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
97 per cent. of the implements from Lake Constance are of nephrite,
while the other three per cent. are nearly equally divided between
jadeite and chloromelanite. In the Zürich Museum he found 28
implements of nephrite, one of jadeite, and six of chloromelanite.
Of the former, 22 are from Meilen and four from Robenhausen. Out of
295 in the museums of Berne (which came from the lakes of Neuchâtel,
Bienne, Morat, Inkwyl, and Moosseedorfsee), 118 are of nephrite,
124 of jadeite, and 53 of chloromelanite. From these approximate
calculations we see that while nephrite was greatly in excess of
jadeite in the settlements of Lake Constance and its neighbourhood,
this inequality becomes gradually removed as we move westwards, till
we come to France, where their relative frequency becomes actually
reversed. Chloromelanite, on the other hand, though as a whole much
rarer than either nephrite or jadeite, seems to have been more evenly
distributed. Roundly speaking, we have in all Europe between 300
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
and 400 worked objects of jadeite, and about 200 of chloromelanite,
while those of nephrite amount to twice these numbers combined.</p>

<p>These facts are very suggestive, and undoubtedly give some support
to the theory that these minerals were found by the lake-dwellers
somewhere in their own neighbourhood. But notwithstanding the most
careful searching on the part of geologists and mineralogists not a
particle of any of them has yet been found <i>in situ</i> in any part of
Switzerland. As an inducement to country people to be on the look-out
a reward of 200 francs was offered a few years ago<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
to anyone who could produce a bit of nephrite, found <i>in situ</i>, of
the size of a man's fist, but as far as I know, the reward still lies unclaimed.</p>

<p>Three isolated portions have been found in Germany, one in
the alluvial sands of Potsdam, another in the vicinity of Meersburg,
and a third in the vicinity of Leipzig.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Also in somewhat similar circumstances two portions have been recorded
from Styria.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
It is said to have been found <i>in situ</i> in small quantities in the
rocks of Silesia, as recorded by H. Traube, of Breslau, in an article
entitled "Über den Nephrit von Jordansmühl in Schlesien."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
Mr. Roediger directs attention (by a note in <i>Antiqua</i>, 1884, p. 150)
to the fact that it was stated to have been found in the Canton
Freiburg, in a work published in 1834. A few chips were found in
the prehistoric caves at Mentone associated with worked flints.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>To these remarks on the jade question I have only to add
that Dr. Arzruni<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
maintains that the nephrite and jadeite of the lake-dwellings can be
microscopically shown to differ from the Asiatic mineral. It may also
be interesting to note that 13 small axes or chisels of jade were
found by Schliemann in the prehistoric cities of Troy (<i>Ilios</i>, p. 240).</p>

<p>As to the huts or cottages in which the lake-dwellers lived
the evidence is still somewhat scanty. For a long time the only
indications that huts were erected over the platforms consisted
of portions of clay having the impressions of round timber
(<b><a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a></b>, No. 2), hearth-stones, and some
stray beams and bits of thatching. Recently, however, more definite information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
has been brought forward by Mr. Frank, the investigator of the
lake-dwelling at Schussenried. This settlement had none of the
signs of having been destroyed by fire, and it is supposed that its
inhabitants voluntarily abandoned it on account of the growth of the
surrounding peat. In this case it is probable that the huts would be
allowed to fall into natural decay, but before this happened there
was a chance that some part of the buildings would become overtaken
by the moss, and so become, as it were, hermetically sealed up. That
something like this actually occurred is now proved by the discovery
at this station of the foundations and portions of the walls of a
cottage deeply buried in the moss. Upon the discovery being known
Mr. Frank had the ruins at once uncovered, and before the crumbling
materials disappeared there was a plan of the building taken, which by
the courtesy of the investigator I had an opportunity of inspecting.
The structure was of an oblong rectangular form, about 33 feet long
and 23 feet wide, and was divided by a partition into two chambers.
On the south side there was a door, a little over 3 feet wide, which
opened into one of the chambers. The other, or inner chamber, was
somewhat larger, and had no communication with the outside, except
through the former by means of a door in the partition. There were no
relics found in these chambers, but in the outer there was a mass of
stones which showed signs of having been a fire-place. The walls were
constructed of split stems set upright and their crevices plastered
over with clay. The flooring in both chambers was composed of four
layers of closely laid timbers separated by as many layers of clay.
These repeated floorings may have been necessitated by the gradual
rise of the surrounding peat which ultimately drove the inhabitants away.</p>

<p>Mr. Messikommer (B. 406c) in the course of his investigations
at Robenhausen found, over an area of 33 yards long and 10 broad,
indications of what he considered to be four separate dwellings. From
a study of the peculiar grouping and distribution of the industrial
remains over this area he came to the conclusion that each cottage had
its own special furniture, a hearth, weaving appliances, a millstone,
sharpening-stones, etc., and on this principle he determines the size
of the huts. From these calculations the size of the Robenhausen
cottages would be almost identical with that at Schussenried, each
having an area of about 750 square feet. From observations made at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
Irgenhausen similar results were obtained. At Niederweil, where the
limits of contiguous dwellings were clearly definable, the area
assigned to each was found to be somewhat less.</p>

<p>Swiss archæologists pretend to see, in the remains of their
lacustrine villages of the Stone Age, evidence of three distinct
periods, which are thus formulated by Dr. Gross:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Les fouilles que j'ai faites, depuis une dizaine d'années, dans les villages
lacustres de l'âge de la pierre, m'ont prouvé qu'ils n'ont pas tous été
habités à la même époque, mais qu'ils remontent à trois périodes
différentes bien caractérisées.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Dans la <i>première période</i>, je range les stations les plus anciennes,
représentées, dans le lac de Bienne, par la palafitte de Chavannes
(Tschaffis), près de Neuveville. Les produits de l'industrie humaine
trouvés sur ces emplacements, dénotent un art tout-à-fait primitif; les
haches de pierre sont petites, à peine polies et presques toutes en minéral
indigène; les haches-marteaux n'apparaissent que sous forme de grossières
ébauches, et les outils en corne et en os sont mal travaillés. On ne
remarque aucune trace d'ornementation, ni sur les armes et les instruments,
ni sur les produits de la céramique. La poterie, du reste, est
façonnée d'une argile grossière, sans l'aide du tour naturellemente, et
revêt des formes qui trahissent l'enfance de l'art du potier.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"La <i>seconde période</i>, à la quelle appartient l'ancienne station de Locras,
celle de Latrigen et en général la plus grande partie de nos établissements
de l'âge de la pierre, présente déjà un notable progrès sur la précédente,
en ce que les armes et les outils sont perfectionnés, les haches en pierre,
quelquefois perforées pour recevoir le manche, sont fort bien travaillées,
polies avec soin et revêtent parfois des dimensions colossales. On
constate aussi dans ces stations une abondance relative de hachettes
en néphrite, jadéïte et chloromélanite. En effet, tandis que ces objets en
minéral étranger font presque entièrement défaut pendant la première et la
troisième période, on les rencontré dans les stations qui nous occupent dans
une proportion qui peut varier du 5 au 8% des haches en minéral indigène.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Le métal n'apparaît pas encore dans cette période, ou du moins pas
dans la couche archéologique; exceptionnellement, on trouve, ici et là,
entre les pilotis, quelques lamelles de cuivre, et plus rarement de bronze.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"La poterie, faite d'une pâte plus fine et mieux façonnée, présente
quelques traces d'ornementation sous forme d'éminences percées et de
dents de loup.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Enfin la <i>troisième période</i> comprend les stations de l'époque de transition
de la pierre au bronze. C'est <i>l'époque du cuivre</i>, si je puis l'appeler
ainsi, caractérisée par la présence dans la couche archéologique même,
d'armes et d'instruments de cuivre pur (très-rarement de bronze), de
haches-marteaux habilement perforées, d'outils de bois et de corne très bien
façonnés, et surtout de vases de formes variées, quelques-uns munis
d'anses et la plupart ornés de dessins faits avec les doigts ou au moyen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
de ficelle imprimée dans l'argile encore molle. Comme je l'ai déjà fait
remarquer plus haut, les haches en néphrite et jadéïte sont devenues plus
rares et font même presque entièrement défaut." (B. 392, p. 2.)</p>

<p>It will be remembered that a similar subdivision of the Stone
Age was adopted by M. Borel in his essay on the lacustrine stations
along the Bevaix shore. (<a href="#Page_49">See page 49</a>.) In my opinion
there are no archæological grounds for such a classification; but I retain
its nomenclature as a matter of convenience, especially the term
"Transition" period. The inhabitants of Schaffis (referred to by
Dr. Gross, and acknowledged to be one of the oldest stations in
Switzerland), knew and practised the art of boring and sawing stones;
they possessed implements of nephrite and jadeite (<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>,
No. 29), and in the manufacture of the usual flint implements they
were, according to Dr. v. Fellenberg, pre-eminent. In the assortment
of objects from this station in the Cantonal Museum at Berne are to
be seen some fantastically-shaped and perforated clubs of horn and
bone, a large needle, and five peculiar objects of horn, similar to
those found on so many of the stations of the period of transition
as Sutz, Gerlafingen, etc. (Nos. 26 and 27), pieces of cloth, flax
combs, a variety of clay weights, stone axe-hammers in all stages of
manufacture, well-shaped daggers of flint and bone, flint saws in
their wooden handles. On this station Dr. Gross also describes the
finding of portions of a ladder; and Dr. Keller (B. 336, p. 48) part
of a door or window containing a long bolt (No. 25). It is true that
the specimens of pottery are coarse and devoid of ornamentation; but
this might have been due to social causes rather than a deficiency of
knowledge, as we find that in some of the other early stations, as
for example Schussenried, the pottery is highly ornamented. In the
struggle for existence the original founders of the lake-dwellings,
surrounded by fierce aborigines and wild animals, had to pay more
attention to the mere necessaries of life than to art. With the
progress of time there are indications of considerable prosperity and
a corresponding advancement in culture, but nothing worthy of being
characterised as a separate period till the introduction of bronze,
which, by facilitating all mechanical and industrial operations,
produced a social revolution. But this change was only by degrees, and
the overlap of the Stone and Bronze Ages is appropriately designated
the period of transition. However long or short the lake-dwellers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
existed in the pure Stone Age (in regard to which there is not much
evidence), one thing is clear, that during all that time the essential
elements of their culture and civilisation underwent little or no change.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;TRANSITION PERIOD.</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the changes brought about in
the social economy of the lake-dwellers by the introduction of
the metals, there is an important problem that demands a few
passing remarks, viz. the evidence as to the existence of a
Copper Age in Europe. The theory of those who advocate
the affirmative of this problem, among whom are notably Professor
v. Pulszky, of Buda-Pesth, and Dr. Much, of Vienna, is that
the prehistoric people of Europe became first acquainted with
the art of extracting copper from its ore, which they fashioned
both by smelting and hammering into various kinds of weapons,
implements, and ornaments. In the first instance these were
mere imitations of objects previously in use. Thus the flat axe
or celt, almost the only form ever found in copper in Europe
(except Hungary), was clearly formed on the model of the stone
implements previously in use. Daggers and spear-heads are also
imitations of their flint prototypes, as may be strikingly seen
by a comparison of <b><a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a></b>, No. 11,
with <b><a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a></b>, No. 2,
the former being flint, and the latter copper.</p>

<p class="space-below2">As the very strongest arguments in support of a Copper
Age are derived from the number and variety of objects of pure copper that
have come to light through lake-dwelling researches, I will endeavour,
as briefly as possible, to point out their general bearing on this
problem. We have already seen that in many instances celts, daggers,
beads, and other objects of copper were found on various stations, but
almost invariably associated with bronze objects, as was the case,
for example, at Wollishofen. There can hardly be any doubt that the
transition from Stone to the most flourishing period of the Bronze Age
took place during the occupation of this lacustrine settlement, but to
infer that its copper objects were the products of a Copper Age would
manifestly be overstepping the limits of a legitimate conclusion. From
these long-lived settlements, with their promiscuous contents, we must
turn to those which have come, as it were, to a premature end, just
shortly after the first metal objects began to be used, but before
the full development of the Bronze Age. From such stations in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
the lake-dwelling area I select the following seven as the most
interesting, viz.:&mdash;Polada, Laibach, Mondsee, Robenhausen, Locras,
Vinelz, and St. Blaise. In the following table I have tabulated all
the metal objects that I can find on record, or deposited in local
collections, as coming from these stations.</p>

The total number of copper objects tabulated by Mr. Forrer,
in his carefully prepared "Statistick der in der Schweiz gefundenen
Kupfergeräthe,"<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
amounts to 250. Of these, 107 are beads or ornaments, and of the
remaining number, 37 are flat celts&mdash;the rest being chisels,
knives, daggers, hammers, etc. The copper finds on the other stations,
except the seven here mentioned, may be dispensed with as weakening
rather than strengthening the evidence for a separate Copper Age,
because there was a preponderance of bronze objects associated with
them, as was the case, for example, at Lattringen and Gerlafingen.</p>

<p>Looking now at our seven selected stations we see, from the general
character of the relics with which the metal objects were associated,
that they belonged essentially to the Stone Age; and it would appear
as if the use of the metals had not been sufficiently long known to
alter their prevailing character. Now it will be observed that in
all these seven stations, except one, viz. Vinelz, objects of bronze
were also found associated with those of copper. On the other hand,
Polada has yielded only a few bronze weapons, and yet there can be no
doubt that this station existed during the earliest Transition period.
Nor is it in this respect singular, as at Ober-Meilen there were two
objects of bronze, viz. a flat celt and a bracelet, associated with
relics of the Stone Age, but none of copper. Also in the transition
station at Morges (Roseaux) there were no less than 18 bronze celts
of the same type, together with a few other objects of this material,
but none of copper. On the supposition that a Copper Age prevailed
for any length of time as a preliminary to that of Bronze, it would
follow that the station at Vinelz was earlier than the others. The
character of its relics does not, however, bear this interpretation,
as the perforated hatchets and other relics are more numerous and
more elegant than anywhere else, and some of its pottery is highly
ornamented and in some respects resembles that of the Bronze Age. The
arrow-points and daggers of flint are exceedingly well formed, and
among a variety of types of the former there are some with recurved
barbs. Also this station is rich in cloth, nets, thread, bone buttons,
etc., and corresponds in every respect with that of Locras, on which
a sword and a dagger of bronze were found along with a few copper
implements. The mere absence of bronze in Vinelz is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
a sufficient reason, <i>per se</i>, to suppose that it existed
in a pure Copper Age without a knowledge of bronze. All the copper
objects from the other stations bear the same evidence of
primitive workmanship as those from it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the earliest bronze objects, wherever found,
such as the swords and daggers, etc., from Locras, Polada, and
Laibach, show a totally different and a much higher style of
manufacture; but yet there is not even presumptive evidence in
favour of the idea that they represent a later date than the crude
copper tools and weapons of Vinelz. The contemporaneity of more or
fewer bronze objects in the six other stations of the Transition
period above named entirely outweighs the exceptional evidence of
this one. Admitting that these copper objects were fabricated by the
lake-dwellers, a supposition which is rendered highly probable by
the finding of so many crucibles at Robenhausen, Mondsee, Laibach,
and other places, we must also admit that their fabricators were
somehow acquainted with the superior qualities of bronze implements.
Consequently the manufacture of these inferior articles must be
explained on some other grounds than the supposition of a Copper Age,
in the sense that it preceded and gradually developed into that of
Bronze. I fancy the true explanation is that the lake-dwellers became
first acquainted with metal instruments in the form of imported bronze
objects, especially swords and daggers, and that this suggested to
them, and directly led to, the discovery of the art of reducing the
pure metal from the copper ore. Local or peripatetic coppersmiths, in
trying to imitate these imported implements, went on manufacturing
copper objects until they learned the art of hardening it by the
proper admixture of tin. This knowledge might have been originally
kept a great secret. But, however this may be, it is certain that
the secret was not long kept, as we soon find the lake-dwellers in
full possession of the art of manufacturing all manner of bronze
objects. Ignorance of the nature of the alloy or perhaps the scarcity
or dearness of tin, leading to wilful deception on the part of the
fabricators, may partly account for the production of some of these
copper implements. It has also been suggested that the repeated
melting of bronze causes the tin to disappear, and that in this
way copper objects may have come about. But this explanation is
inapplicable to those from the lake-dwellings, as they are all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
of the most primitive type, and were undoubtedly manufactured
during the initiatory stages of the metallurgic art.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;BRONZE AGE.</h3>

<p>The art of manufacturing cutting implements of bronze, when once
known, must have come quickly into general use, owing to their vast
superiority over those in previous use, whether of stone or copper.
Not only was there a great impulse given to the ordinary affairs of
life, but actually new industries must have been developed. In lieu
of the primitive weapons and tools previously in use, we have now
a splendid array of swords, daggers, lances, axes, knives, rasors,
chisels, gouges, sickles, etc. The simple dagger of bone or flint,
which could only be used by a thrusting blow, became not only more
specialised and a more powerful weapon, but developed into a new
weapon&mdash;the double-edged sword. The first form of this weapon
which found its way to the lake-dwellers appears to have been that
with a flat handle (<b><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a></b>, Nos. 1, 7, and 9),
with a series of rivet holes for attaching plates of bone or wood, so as to
give a better grip to the wielder. Subsequently the handle was cast
separately of solid bronze, and the blade was then attached to it
by means of rivets. One of the most elegant of these forms was that
terminating at the hilt in a couple of spirals, several examples of
which are illustrated on <b><a href="#Fig_11">Figs. 11</a></b>,
<b><a href="#Fig_19">19</a></b>, and <b><a href="#Fig_186">186</a></b>.
From Moeringen there is a very rare sword of this type, but portion
of the handle is broken off. The blade is of iron and the handle of
bronze ornamented with encrusted bands of iron
(<b><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a></b>, No. 6).</p>

<p>Such sharp-edged weapons entailed the necessity of caution when
carried about the person, and accordingly sheaths were used, probably
in the first place made of wood and tipped with bronze. Objects
supposed to be these tips have been found at various places, as
Moeringen, Auvernier, Champreveyères, Luissel
(<b><a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a></b>, No. 4),
Bourget, etc. (<b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>, No. 20).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span></p>

and all the rest = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p>While daggers were riveted to handles of solid bronze, horn, or
other materials (<b><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a></b>, No. 8), a form which
they retained during the whole Bronze Age, lance-heads were from the earliest
times made with sockets. Arrow-points were subject to greater variations,
as we find them tanged, socketed, or merely triangularly-shaped flat
pieces. The latter had generally two or four small holes by means of
which they were fastened to the stem by a wire or thread
(<b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>, Nos. 22 to 26). Hatchets display a series
of evolutionary improvements, the various stages of which can be readily traced.
Thus the primitive stone form, which was alone adhered to in the few
copper examples hitherto found, was also continued in bronze, and in
this form the bronze axe spread largely over Europe. But it gradually
gave way to that with flaps, or wings, with or without loops for
fixing the instrument more firmly to its handle. Finally we have the
socketed hatchet, which appears to have been considered the best form
in use during the Bronze Age. It was only when iron superseded bronze
in the use of cutting implements that the modern type, <i>i.e.</i> with a
transverse hole for the handle, came into general use, although the
principle was well known in previous ages, and, indeed, acted upon,
as in the perforated stone hammers and axes. Bronze saws
(<b><a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a></b>, No. 7) appear to have been used to an extremely
limited extent, as only some half-a-dozen examples have been found on the whole
lake-dwelling area of Central Europe. Their rarity in comparison with
the superabundance of flint saws in the Stone Age may be accounted
for by the large number of sharp cutting instruments that were now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
prevalent, and which were better adapted for many of the purposes to
which the saws were formerly put, such as the making of arrow-stems,
wooden handles, etc. The ordinary knives of the palafittes are
extremely elegant in form, the blade being always more or less curved,
and frequently ornamented with parallel or wavy lines and running
patterns of concentric circles and dots. They were generally hafted
by means of a tang or socket, but sometimes the blade and handle were
made in one solid casting. Numerous examples of all these different
forms are given in our illustrations.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the socketed knives are very rare
in Eastern Switzerland, not a single example being recorded from the
great find at Wollishofen, while, as we move westward, they increase
relatively, till in Lake Bourget they become the rule and not the
exception.</p>

<p>The blades which go under the name of razors, though of diversified
forms, may be divided into two kinds, according as they are single-or
double-bladed. The former have a ridged back, which generally projects
at one end, so as to become a short handle, often assuming the form
of a terminal ring, as shown in <b><a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a></b>, Nos. 22 and 23.
One in the Gross collection has a handle of staghorn. The latter,
or double-bladed, have the handle placed intermediately between
the blades, and are common in the terremare and the palatfitte of
Peschiera (<b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>), but they do not occur in Lake
Bourget. The small pincers supposed to be for epilation, so common in La Tène
and in Gallo-Roman times, appear to have come into use towards the
close of the Bronze Age, as they are extremely rare in the palafittes
of Central Switzerland, but more common in those of Lake Bourget.
One is figured by Dr. Gross, from Moeringen, similar to the one here
represented from Lake Bourget (<b><a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a></b>, No. 24).</p>

<p>Sickles were also widely distributed over the lake-dwelling area of
the Bronze Age, including the terremare. They are flat on the under
side, but on the upper side they have two or more ridges running
lengthways, the object of which was to strengthen the implement. By
means of a raised knob, or rivet-hole, and sometimes a projecting
spur, it was firmly fixed into a wooden handle, as seen in <b><a href="#Fig_187">Fig. 187</a></b>.
That represented here was found at Moeringen, and is adroitly
fashioned by hollows and rounding ridges, adapted for the right hand.
That this was the normal condition of these handles is probable from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
the fact that other two similar objects were found at Corcelettes,
which are now preserved in the Museum at Lausanne.</p>

<p>As regards hammers, chisels, gouges, punches, awls, needles,
hooks, and spears for fishing, etc., it is unnecessary to add to the
descriptive details already given, and their general characters are
sufficiently patent from the illustrations.</p>

The smaller figure shows<br /> the manner of using<br />this implement.</p>
</div>

<p>In the category of objects used for the toilet and personal
ornament we have a large assortment of new and fanciful forms, such
as bracelets, pendants, necklaces, fibulæ, pins, combs, belt-clasps,
finger-rings, buttons, studs, earrings, chains, as well as a few
ornaments of gold, amber, and glass.</p>

<p>First in importance are the armlets or anklets, which greatly
differ as regards size, form, and ornamentation (<b><a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a></b>,
etc.). They are closed or open. The former are solid or hollow
rings, and either plain or ornamented with the usual geometrical
figures of incised lines, circles, and dots variously combined. The
open bracelets are more numerous, and have a wider range of style
and pattern. Some consist of a stout wire, spirally grooved, in
single or double ply (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 15), or a flat band
with a terminal hook and eye for fastening when worn over the arm. Others are
penannular, with flat expansions at each end, and the more massive
are hollowed in the centre so as to reduce their weight. These latter
are peculiar to the palafittes of Western Switzerland, having their
greatest development in the lakes of Neuchâtel, Bienne, and Morat.
They occur in Lake Bourget, but not to the same extent as the solid
forms. Jet bracelets are rare, only one or two being recorded from the
Swiss palafittes (<b><a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a></b>, No. 14); but they
are more numerous in Lake Bourget. One is of tin (<b><a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a></b>, No. 3).</p>

<p>Pendants and such like ornaments affect so many different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
forms that it would be idle here to attempt to classify them. They
have all one common element, viz. a perforation or ring at the top for
suspension, and it is probable that many of them are merely individual
parts of a compound ornament, like that found at Auvernier, and
figured by Dr. Gross (B. 392, Pl. xxiii. 33), in which there are no
less than fourteen different pendants hanging from a central wheel.
But no doubt many of them, especially the larger forms, such as those
found on the palafitte at Onens (<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>,
Nos. 1 to 3), must have been used as single decorations.</p>

and Tin Bracelets.</span> All <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p>Necklaces formed by stringing together beads of various materials,
such as that represented on <b> <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a></b>, No. 1, were
probably a common method of personal adornment; but of course they are seldom
met with except as individual beads. Solid rings for the neck, or
torques, are extremely rare, their entire number recorded from the
lake-dwellings of the Bronze Age being less than half-a-dozen. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
are all of one type, and similar to the two illustrations given in
<b><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></b>, No. 3, from Cortaillod, and
<b><a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a></b>, No. 19, from Peschiera.</p>

</div>

<p>Fibulæ were not quite so rare as the torques, and they appear to
have been pretty equally distributed over the lake-dwelling area, both
north and south of the Alps. Though well represented at Peschiera,
their existence in the true terramara deposits is still a matter of
contention among archæologists. From a glance at the various examples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
given in our illustrations (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 20;
<b><a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a></b>, Nos. 4, 9, and 10;
<b><a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a></b>, Nos. 4, 12, 14, and 26), etc., it will
be seen that they occupy an intermediate place between the straight
pin and the more highly developed and elaborate forms found among
relics of later ages.</p>

<p>Pins are the most common objects among the industrial remains of
the lake-dwellings, the total number found in the Swiss stations alone
being approximately over 10,000. Their principal function was to adorn
the hair, but no doubt some were used for other purposes, such as the
fastening of garments, and so they took the place of the fibulæ. They
are extremely varied in size and style of manufacture, being of all
grades from an inch up to 30 inches in length, and from the simple
unadorned stem with a mere knob for a head up to the highly decorated
examples so numerously represented in our illustrations, such for
example as those with massive heads in the form of a hollow globe
(<b><a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a></b>, No. 12), or cup
(<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 9), or expanded
disc (<b><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></b>, No. 24). Some had a loose ring for a head, to
which in some instances bits of chains were attached (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>,
No. 6). In Lake Bourget a few were found with flat wheel-shaped heads
(<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>, Nos. 4 and 5).</p>

<p>Bronze combs are fairly well represented both in the terremare and
the lacustrine dwellings. They are almost invariably small, with a
single or double row of teeth. Clasps for girdles like the one figured
from Bourget (<b><a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a></b>, No. 25) are in the Gross collection,
as well as a few others of a slightly different form. Buttons, studs,
chains, finger-rings of single or more coils, earrings, glass and
amber beads are also so numerous and widely spread as to show that
they were not merely exceptional objects among the lake-dwellers.</p>

<p>Several bronze dishes, not exceeding a dozen in all, have been
found on several of the Swiss stations. They are in the form of small
wide-mouthed cups of beaten bronze, with or without handles, and
often ornamented with slightly raised knobs of repoussé work
(<b><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></b>, No. 20), or like small jars of
cast bronze (<b><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a></b>, No. 22,
and <b><a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a></b>, No. 2). Fragments of larger dishes,
like the Etruscan situlæ made of thin sheets riveted together, with massive
handles also attached by rivets, have been found at Wollishofen
(<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, Nos. 17 and 22).</p>

<p>Gold is only sparingly met with, and the objects are generally
small or fragmentary. In this condition specimens of the precious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
metal are among the relics from Nidau, Moeringen (<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>,
No. 8), Auvernier, Concise, Cortaillod, Montilier, Wollishofen, and
Lake Bourget, etc. A few objects are of tin, the most frequently met
with being small wheels with four, five, or eight spokes, which are
recorded from several stations, portion of a ring and a bracelet
from Montilier (<b><a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a></b>, No. 3), a small bar pierced
with 16 holes from Corcelettes (<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>, No. 12), and a
pendant from Auvernier (No. 7), a small cross from Lake Garda (<b><a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a></b>,
No. 26), etc. Tin is also represented in small ingots and, as we shall
afterwards more particularly notice, it was used to decorate the
inside of various dishes of earthenware.</p>

<p>To these industrial objects, many of which had their prototypes in
the Stone Age, we have to add a variety of appliances for carrying on
the metallurgical art. Stone anvils gave place to bronze ones, and of
these the most remarkable is that from Wollishofen (<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>,
No. 21). Moulds were generally made of sandstone or hardened clay,
the former being the most numerous, and specimens may be seen in all
the collections from the stations both north and south of the Alps.
It will be recollected that the two valves of a mould for a winged
celt made of bronze were found at Morges at a very early stage in
lacustrine investigations (<b><a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a></b>, No. 8). For many
years this apparatus remained as a solitary and unique example of this kind of
mould, but now three other valves, similar to those from Morges, have
been found, one on each of the stations of Auvernier, Corcelettes,
and Estavayer (<b><a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a></b>, No. 22). Crucibles are abundantly
represented. They are of various shapes and sizes, sometimes with a
solid handle, as those from Rohenhausen and St. Blaise, and at other
times with a short projection having a perforation through which a
wooden stick could be inserted as a handle (<b><a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a></b>, No. 3,
and <b><a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a></b>, No. 14). As further evidence that the founder
practised his art <i>in situ</i> we have various records of the finding of
ingots of copper, tin, and lead; also slag, defective castings, scoriæ
and refuse of smelting furnaces. In the Gross collection there is a
circular cake of tin with a small ring for suspension similar to a
leaden cake figured from Wollishofen (<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>, No. 23). The huge
mass of copper in the form of a double celt (<b><a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a></b>, No. 10)
was probably for the same end, and not intended as an implement at all.</p>

<p>In Dr. Evan's collection there is a remarkable bronze knife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
(<b><a href="#Fig_190">Fig. 190</a></b>) from Bourget, having the handle
and blade made of one solid casting, which appears as if it had just been
freshly extracted from the mould. It has evidently undergone no
subsequent polish, and still retains a thin irregular rim all round,
corresponding with the junction of the two halves of the stone mould.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be supposed that I claim all the
multifarious objects found in the <i>débris</i> of the lake-dwellings
as products of native art; on the contrary, I believe there are many
objects, especially the more complicated and ornamental, which can be
traced to foreign sources. But on the other hand the mere inspection
of the extensive assortment of foundry materials, especially the
variety of moulds which include swords (B. 282, Pl. liv. Fig 2, and
B. 392, Pl. xxix. Fig. 11), daggers, spears, knives, sickles, all
kinds of celts and chisels, bracelets, buckles, pins, rings, wheels,
etc., leaves no doubt that the home industry in the manufacture of
bronze was extensive and skilfully conducted. Indeed, the skill and
ingenuity displayed in casting such a variety of objects can only
excite our astonishment. How the series of involved and massive rings
of cast bronze represented on <b><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></b>, No. 1, was
produced, is really a mystery. A model of such an object made of wax if embedded
in soft clay, and subsequently hardened by exposure to heat so as to
melt the wax and thus allow it to escape, might supply the founder
with the requisite mould. But that this was the method adopted by
the lacustrian founder is, of course, a mere conjecture.

<p>That the horse was now domesticated and under the control of the
lake-dwellers we have very circumstantial evidence in the discovery
of bridle-bits, various ornaments for harness, and even a wheel and
other mountings of a chariot or biga. For many years some curious and
highly polished portions of horn from 4 to 7 inches in length, and
perforated with three or more holes, one in the centre and the other
at the extremities, were among the unexplained relics of the Bronze
Age stations (<b><a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a></b>, Nos. 3 and 4). The holes
in these objects had a worn appearance, and it was noticed that the direction
of the central aperture was always at right angles to those at the
extremities. Their use however, remained a complete puzzle till
the year 1872, when a remarkably fine and well preserved horse-bit
of bronze was discovered at Moeringen (No. 7). The similarity of
these horn objects to the side pieces of the bronze bit led to the
conjecture that they were the analogous parts of horse-bits made of horn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
The subsequent discovery of several other bronze bits, all of the
same type, gradually strengthened this opinion; but whatever doubt
might remain as to their function is now dispelled by the discovery
at Corcelettes, in 1888, of a complete specimen made of two tines of
staghorn with a transverse mouthpiece of bone (No. 1). Of the bronze
bridle-bits found up to this time only three are entire, but there are
several isolated side and centre pieces from the stations of Nidau,
Moeringen, Auvernier, Corcelettes, and Estavayer (Nos. 5, 6, and 9).
It will be observed that all the examples here figured (which include
the most diverse forms), though differing in some details, are of the
same type. The only marked difference in the two entire specimens is
that one (No. 7) has the mouthpiece divided in the middle, whereas the
other (No. 8) is one solid piece. This latter was found at Corcelettes
and is now in the Lausanne Museum. The third entire specimen, which
was also found at Corcelettes, appears from its illustration
(B. 462) to be identical with No. 8.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Gross, No. 7 was made in one casting, thus
proving the perfection to which bronze working was carried. All
these specimens of horse-bits, so far as can be judged from the
breadth of the mouthpiece, indicate very small horses, No. 7 being
3&frac12; inches between the side pieces, and No. 8 rather less
than 4 inches.</p>

<p>The entire bridle-bit of horn is even still smaller, being
only 2&frac34; inches wide. It is thus described by Dr. Brière
(B. 461):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Cette intéressante pièce, en parfait état de conservation, se compose
de 2 branches en bois de cerf, percées chacune de 3 trous evidées à
la partie supérieure sur un profondeur de 3 centimètres et mesurant
18 centimètres de longeur, reliées entre' elles par la barre du mors
qui est en os et mesure exactement 7 centimètres entre les 2 branches.
Cette barre en os est creuse et pour assujettir la pièce aux branches,
on a enfoncé de petits coins en corne de cerf pour combler le vide et
pour la rendre solide."&mdash;<i>Antiqua</i>, 1888, p. 37.</p>

<p>Judging from the frequency with which the isolated side-pieces of
bridle-bits made of horn have been found on almost all the bronze
stations, no less than 12 being now preserved in the Munich Museum
from Starnberg, and 14 in the Lausanne Museum from Corcelettes, the
horse must have been common among the lake-dwellers. It will also be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
remembered that similar objects have been found in the terremare, and
Dr. Carlo Boni thinks that a piece of rope was used instead of the
stiff mouthpiece in the manner shown in No. 2.</p>

<p>There are various other objects which are supposed to have been
used as ornaments for horse harness, such as the <i>phaleræ</i> or
bronze discs, rings, knobs, etc. The former (Nos. 11 to 13) are often
slightly convex on one side and decorated with circles or small knobs
formed in repoussé work, and on the other side there is a small loop
for fastening it. Several horn and bone discs, especially those from
Starnberg (<b><a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a></b>, Nos. 24 and 30) suggest a similar usage.</p>

<p>Two curious bronze objects (<b><a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a></b>, No. 10)
found on the eastern shore of Lake Neuchâtel, one at Chevroux and the other at
Estavayer, together with portion of a hollow tube of a similar style
of ornamentation, remained for a long time unexplained. However,
coupled with the bronze wheel found at Cortaillod (<b><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></b>, No. 17)
Dr. Keller showed that they were the handles and part of the top
railing of an Etruscan biga or war chariot. (B. 336.)</p>

<p>The use of the long pins of brass with sword-like handles
(<i>Säbelnadeln</i>) found on the stations of Wollishofen (<b><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a></b>,
Nos. 9 and 10), Grosser Hafner (<b><a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a></b>, No. 32), and the Grand
City of Morges, is not yet sufficiently understood. In 1886
Major v. Tröltsch,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
in a note to the Society of Anthropology in Berlin, directed
attention to the fact that an object of the same kind was preserved
in the Museum at Donaueschingen, which had been found in a Burgwall
(<i>Lagerplatz</i>) on the Hohenhöwen, "einem der vulkanischen Bergkegel
des Hegau's bei Singen." The object thus described by Major v.
Tröltsch is precisely similar to that here figured from the Grosser
Hafner (<b><a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a></b>, No. 32). Its total length is 16&frac12; inches,
of which the pin takes up 13 inches and the terminal ring 1&#8540; inch.
The stem presents a square section, and in this respect it agrees with
the examples found at Zürich and Morges. Subsequently
Dr. L. v. Rau,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Mr. R Forrer,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
and Mr. Heierli<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
contributed to the Society some further notes on these singular
implements, but without coming to any agreement as to their function.

</div>

<p>In addition to these bronze relics so numerously described and
illustrated in the previous pages, there are many objects which
cannot be classified under any of the previous headings, as their
use is unknown. Fragments of small hollow globes are supposed to
have been used as children's rattles. Examples of these have been
found at Moeringen made of pottery, two of which, now in the Museum
at Berne, are still perfect (<b><a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a></b>, No. 9). Both
objects are ornamented, and contain inside a piece of hardened clay which,
when shaken, makes a jingling noise. In the Museum at Zürich there
is, also from Moeringen, a small pendant like a bell now used on
horse harness (<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>, No. 17). Dr. Gross (B. 392, p. 75)
describes a similar object found at Auvernier (<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>, No.
18) as a perfume-box (cassolette). Among the more recent finds is the
object represented on <b><a href="#Fig_192">Fig. 192</a></b>, which is supposed to be part
of a mirror similar to those so frequently met with among Etruscan
and Roman remains. (B. 420, p. 167.) We have already observed that on
several of the Scottish crannogs there were found some thin stones,
highly polished and circular or square, which are supposed to have
been used for the same purpose. These stones, when moistened with
water and looked at in certain conditions as regards light, are by no
means a bad substitute for the more perfect reflecting mirrors of
the present day.</p>

<p>These great innovations following in the wake of the metals could
hardly fail to influence such a plastic art as that of the potter.
Accordingly we find a better quality of paste, greater variety and
elegance of form, and some approach to systematic decoration. There is
one new form quite characteristic of this age which, were it not for
the extreme elegance and harmony of all its parts, one would suppose
indicated a retrograde movement. This was a small water-bottle-shaped
vase, which, having a conical base, could not be made to sit upright
upon a flat surface without some kind of support. This support is
supposed to be a clay ring (<b><a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a></b>, Nos. 2, 5, and 31), great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
numbers of which have been found in the Bronze Age stations.
Ultimately colouring materials were introduced which considerably
enhanced the effect of ornamentation on the dishes. Besides systematic
patterns of recurring geometrical figures formed by lines in the soft
clay, we sometimes find similar patterns traced on the surface of the
vessels by means of thin strips of tin-foil made to adhere by means
of a kind of gum or asphalt. The vessels thus manipulated were of
extremely elegant forms, and made of a fine paste with a smooth black
surface. This custom was particularly prevalent in Lake Bourget, but
specimens have been found in some of the other lakes, as at Nidau,
Hauterive, Cortaillod, Montilier, Estavayer, etc., but it is extremely
rare in Eastern Switzerland. On <b><a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a></b> I have
shown a few additional specimens of pottery. No. 1 is the quarter of a dish shaped
like a milk plate having a small flat base. It is perforated with
groups of holes arranged systematically as shown in the illustration,
and the inside is ornamented with a few incised circles. This dish, or
rather percolator, was found in Lake Bourget, and formed part of Mr.
Rabut's collection now in the British Museum. Another percolator, of
similar shape and size, differently ornamented, and having a slight
variation in the disposition of the grouped perforations, was found
at Montilier, and is figured by Keller. (B. 126, Pl. v. 26.) No. 2
represents the quarter of a dish of the same form as the above, but
without perforations. Its interior is adorned with strips of tin-foil
(here represented in white) producing a wonderfully complicated
design. This dish was found at Cortaillod, and is now in the Schwab
Museum, along with an extremely handsome wide-mouthed vase, also
from Cortaillod, the outside of which is similarly ornamented. In
the latter case the upper part of the vessel is surrounded by small
panels all having different designs made of circles, lines, and
crosses. (See B. 126, Pl. xvi. 1.) No. 6 is a vase with conical base,
from Hauterive, also adorned in the same fashion. In looking at these
vessels ornamented with tin it is difficult to make out the designs,
as the tin is now even blacker than the pottery. Hence, in Nos. 4 and
5, both of which are from Lake Bourget, the tin is represented by the
dark lines. No. 3 represents a fragment of pottery, now preserved in
the Museum at Aix-les-Bains, which shows how a broken dish had been
mended by passing two or three plies of a tough grass or rush through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
a perforation on each side of the crack. After the fragments
were thus brought together one of the rushes was twisted in a
spiral manner round the others, evidently for protecting them
from wear and tear. The remaining Nos. (7 to 10) illustrate some
toy dishes and children's playthings from Moeringen and Auvernier.</p>

<p>The spindle-whorls of the Bronze Age are generally made of
earthenware, and often highly ornamented, thus showing the improved

taste of the people.</p>

<p>Among the more notable objects peculiar to the Bronze Age
are certain polished stones, in the form of circular or oval discs
with a marginal groove (<b><a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a></b>). These stones
were formerly reckoned to be sling-stones, but now they are generally recognised
as potters' implements, used probably for fashioning the
bases of the dishes.</p>

</div>

<p>There are many problems worthy of careful consideration suggested
by the facts disclosed in these pages, but in this rapid sketch I can
only refer to one or two in a cursory manner. First of all we have to
inquire if the lake-dwellers practised religious rites. In support
of the affirmative to this inquiry there are some indications, and
the few objects capable of such an interpretation are illustrated on
<b><a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a></b>. In this category I include the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The highly ornamented wooden sticks or <i>bâtons de
commandement</i>, from Castione (Nos. 1 and 2), and from Moeringen
(No. 3). The only perfect example (No. 1) is rather less than sixteen
inches in length, and the others do not appear to have been larger.</p>

<p>(2) The four remarkable bronze tubes with ring appendages from Lake
Bourget (Gresine). These, though differing in size and some other
respects, are all of one type, and were clearly conceived and wrought
out on a uniform plan, and for some specific purpose. The most perfect
of these objects (<a href="#Page_102">see page 102</a>) appears to be complete,
and consists of an ornamental tube, surrounded by three rows of fixed loops,
three in each row, placed at regular distances, and to each loop there are
three loose rings appended, as shown in the illustration (No. 4).
The two previously illustrated (<b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>, Nos. 1 and 2)
have only one ring in each of the nine loops, and it does not appear that
there had been any more. The fourth, now preserved in the Museum at
Chambery, is nearly as large as the perfect one; but it is greatly
worn, and retains now only a few rings, some of the loops being broken
or worn through. It is illustrated by Perrin. (B. 282, Pl. lxiv. 1.)</p>

<p>(3) The ornamental reniform rings (<i>Schwurring</i>) from Morges
and Thonon (<b><a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a></b>, Nos. 2 and 3), could not have
been used as bracelets, and Dr. Forel suggests that they are analogous to the
<i>armilla sacra</i> on which the ancient Germans were wont to place
their hands when about to swear a solemn oath. (B. 286, p. 46.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

Ideas. Nos. 4, 9 to 13, 15 and 16 = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>; 1 to 3, 5 to 8,
14 and 19 = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>; and 17 and 18 = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> real size.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Museum at Brunswick, in Germany, I noticed three of these
rings, one of which is almost identical with the one from Morges,
differing from it only in the details of the ornamentation; but of
their history and origin nothing seems to have been known. Another is
in the Museo Civico, at Turin, as well as a large circular ring like
that from the lacustrine station at Wollishofen (<b><a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a></b>,
No. 2), both of which have been figured by Gastaldi. (B. 294, Pl. xii.) I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
believe it more probable that these large circular rings, though
generally considered to be bracelets, were used for the same purpose
as the reniform rings. Among the objects in the prehistoric and Roman
collection of antiquities in St. Ulric, at Regensberg (Ratisbon),
there is a large hollow ring of bronze, ornamented with three lines of
concentric circles, which measures six inches in external and three
inches in internal diameter, thus leaving one and a half inch for the
thickness of the ring. It was found, along with several other things,
in a pre-Roman grave (<i>Hügel-grab</i>) near Velburg.</p>

<p>(4) The clay images of animals found on several stations in
different parts of the lake-dwelling area, as well as those of the
terremare (<b><a href="#Fig_84">Fig. 84</a></b>, Nos. 23 and 24), and more especially the
human images from Laibach, are probably idols. On <b><a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a></b>,
along with four clay figures from the lakes of Neuchâtel and Bourget
(Nos. 9, 10, 13, and 14), I represent two of bronze (Nos. 15 and
16), which I noticed in a collection from Bodmann, in the Steinhaus
Museum, at Überlingen. One of these was evidently used as a pendant,
and the other appears to have been intended for a human being. The
clay figures from Laibach (Nos. 5 to 8), though fragmentary, are
undoubtedly representations of the human body. Nos. 5 and 6 represent
the back and front view of the trunk of a female, while No. 7 shows
a human body with a prominent nose. These two figures are hollow in
the interior, and richly ornamented exteriorly with designs which are
supposed to be imitations of embroidered garments. Another of these
human figures from Laibach, as well as the image of a small animal, is
represented on <b><a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a></b>, Nos. 11, 23 and 24.</p>

<p>The extraordinary number of implements and chips of nephrite
found at Maurach, and the equal predominance of flint refuse and
implements in all stages of manufacture at some of the other stations,
as Wallhausen, Nussdorf, etc., suggest the idea that the various
industries prosecuted by the inhabitants of the lake-villages had
already developed to such an extent as to become localised in certain
centres. Again, the localisation of certain industries, as comestibles
in one place, flax in its various preparatory stages in another, the
complete kit of foundry tools in a third, etc., all point to the
knowledge and practice of the principles of the division of labour.</p>

<p>That the lake-dwellers kept up commercial relations with foreign
countries is proved by their possessing materials, not only <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
peculiar to distant or limited areas, such as amber, jade, flint,
etc., but also certain objects having such peculiarities in form or
style of ornamentation as have enabled experienced archæologists to
trace them to their original areas of evolution. Thus at Corcelettes
were found an ornamental bronze dish, and portion of a fibula
(<b><a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a></b>, Nos. 19 and 20), which,
when seen by Montelius in the Museum
at Lausanne, were at once recognised by him as of northern origin.
(B. 348.) Dr. Keller has also shown, as already stated, that certain
bronze objects found in the Lake of Neuchâtel, which for a long time
remained a puzzle to archæologists, belonged to an Etruscan carriage
or biga. The few fibulæ found in the Swiss lake-dwellings have also
been traced to their native habitats in Northern Italy.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
The half-moon-shaped flint knives, so characteristic of Scandinavia
and Northern Germany, have been found as far south as the Mondsee,
and one solitary representative (<b><a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a></b>, No. 20),
now in the Museum of Natural History at Stuttgart, is said to have come from
Schussenried station.</p>

<p>One notable fact about the distribution of lake-dwellings is
that their relics conform in style, ornamentation, and general
characteristics, to contemporary antiquities in the surrounding
districts; and I find no special characters in their industrial
remains that bind the lake-dwellers together as one clannish
people. The relics from the lake-dwellings of the Stone Age
in Northern Germany are readily seen to be closely related with
those of the Scandinavian archæological area. Whatever the
original resemblances and points of agreement of the founders
may have been, they were soon modified and adapted to the
physical conditions and requirements of their environments.</p>

<p>That continued attention was paid to the rearing and breeding
of domesticated animals during the Bronze Age is attested by their
osseous remains, which have been critically examined by such competent
authorities as Rütimeyer (B. 42), Studer (B. 404), Uhlmann (B. 336),
and others. While the lake-dwellers of the earlier Stone Age had only
as domestic animals one small species of dog, a small ox, a horned
sheep, and the goat, we find that towards the end of this period and
during the succeeding Bronze Age not only new and large breeds were
developed, but another was added to the list, viz. the horse. From
the remains of the domestic horse found at Moeringen and elsewhere it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
appears to have been a small and slender-limbed animal with small
hoofs, and altogether much inferior to the wild horse as hunted
and eaten by the cave men of palæolithic times, from which it is
supposed to have been a direct descendant. When the Aar canal was
being excavated the bones of the smaller or domestic horse were
found associated with bronze objects in no less than nine different
localities, all of which agree with the above characteristics.
(B. 404.) The horse of the terremare, according to Professor Strobel,
presents the same characters as that of the Swiss lake-dwellings,
and as we have already seen from the bridle-bits and other horse
trappings, there can be no doubt it was also in a state of
domestication. I may also mention that a skull found at Auvernier was
believed by Rütimeyer, after most careful deliberation, to be that of
the ass. Professor Strobel has also recognised the osseous remains of
the ass in the terremare. (B. 389b.) The sheep diverged considerably
from its earlier form, and lost much of its goat-like appearance,
being now larger, and developed into various breeds. Still more varied
were the breeds of cattle, especially in the vicinity of the lakes of
Bienne and Neuchâtel. The Bos primigenius appears to have been tamed
and crossed with the earlier type, giving rise to a variety of breeds,
such as <i>trococeros</i> and <i>frontosus</i>, one of which had wide
branching horns, as is proved from its remains found at Concise, Chevroux,
Locras, etc. The small dog of the Stone Age (<i>Canis domesticus
palustris</i>, Rüt.) gave place to a much larger kind, somewhat
resembling our modern greyhound. The domestic pig also appears to have
passed through various evolutionary phases; but the wild boar still
retained its individuality intact. Dr. Uhlmann in his report on the
osseous remains from the Grosser Hafner, at Zürich (B. 336), describes
three varieties of the pig, as well as three of cattle.</p>

<p>With the exception of the domestic fowl and the tame cat, the
domestic animals reared by the lake-dwellers were similar to those
now extant. Nor is there much change as regards the wild animals and
birds then prevalent. The animals that now frequent the higher Alps,
such as the marmot, chamois, and wild goat, are very scarce in the
lake-dwellings, showing that already nature had consigned them to the
zone of their present habitation. Altogether, with the more improved
weapons of the Bronze Age, there ensued, according to Rütimeyer, a
marked diminution in the relative proportion of the ordinary wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
animals of the chase, and a corresponding increase in those of the
domestic breeds. The great wild oxen, the urus and bison, disappeared
from the neighbourhood altogether.</p>

<p>Such progressive strides in agricultural pursuits are, however,
not discernible in the vegetable remains, notwithstanding the minute
investigations of Professor Heer. (B. 123.) From the very commencement
the lake-dwelling colonists cultivated flax, two or three varieties
of barley and wheat, millet and peas. The only addition that appears
to have been made in the Bronze Age were the oat (<i>Avena sativa</i>),
and the dwarf field bean (<i>Faba vulgaris</i>) of a strikingly small
size. On the other hand we have to note the absence of winter wheat,
rye, hemp, and most of the culinary and garden vegetables. Fruits
and berries were largely used as food, but there is no evidence to
show that they were cultivated. Among these the following have been
identified:&mdash;apples, pears, plums, sloes, one or two species
of cherry, raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries, hazel and
beech nuts, water-chestnuts, poppies, etc. Grape-stones from Wangen
were hesitatingly included in Professor Heer's list of fruits from
the lake-dwellings; but, as already mentioned, this doubt is now
diminished by the finding of grape-stones at Steckborn, another
station of the Stone Age. Stones of the grape were early recognised
among the <i>débris</i> of the palafittes of Lake Garda, and quite recently
Mr. A. Goiran has identified those of the olive (<i>Oleo europæa</i>) and peach.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Bread was made only of wheat and millet, that of the latter
generally containing some grains of wheat and linseed. Cakes
made of the seeds of the poppy were also found at Robenhausen.</p>

<p>Various portions of the osseous remains of man, comprising the
skull and other portions of the skeleton, have been found in several
stations, as Meilen, Wollishofen, Grosser Hafner, Schaffis, Sutz,
Locras, Vinelz, Nidau, Wauwyl, Bevaix, Insel Weerd, etc. All these
remains have been more or less critically examined and reported on by
Virchow (B. 305 and 433), Studer (B. 419 and 432), and Kollmann (B.
420), but notwithstanding a number of minute measurements and learned
disquisitions, contradictory opinions are held by these scientists as
to the race or races of men that inhabited the lake-dwellings. Dr.
Studer advocates the theory of Troyon, that with the introduction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
bronze there was also a new race of people, and this opinion he bases
on the fact that at Sutz and Vinelz two kinds of human skulls were
found, viz. <i>brachycephalic</i> and <i>dolichocephalic</i>, whereas in the
pure Stone Age stations only <i>brachycephalic</i> skulls were met with.
Segments of the upper parts of human skulls supposed to have been
used as drinking cups were found at Gerlafingen (B. 392, p. 107),
Sutz, Schaffis, and Locras, and from the latter there was also a skull
having a circular portion of it cut out, as if trepanning had been
performed. (B. 336, p. 31.)</p>

<p>Although it is now pretty well established that in these
prehistoric times trepanning was practised as far back as the Stone
Age,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
it does not appear that this skull from Locras (B. 336, Pl. v. 28)
had been operated on during the lifetime of the individual. Roundlets,
cut out of skulls, are supposed to have been used as charms, and
they are frequently met with in the graves of the period. From the
lake-dwellings two of these objects have been recorded; one from Concise
(<b><a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a></b>, No. 20)<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
has two small perforations for suspension, and another, with one
hole, is figured by Dr. Gross. (B. 392, Pl. xxiii. 65.) On the Trajan
column a Dacian village is represented having human skulls set on
poles before the walls. (B. 164.) The finding of skulls of a different
race in the lake-dwellings might therefore be accounted for on the
supposition that they were trophies of their enemies and not those
of the occupiers of the lake-dwellings. Anatomical deductions from
the few long bones of skeletons that have come to light indicate,
so far as the evidence goes, that the Bronze Age men were of small
stature&mdash;a conclusion which is also supported by the small size
of the handles of the swords and other weapons of the period.</p>

<p>Professor Virchow in a long review of the craniology of the
Swiss lake-dwellers comes to the following conclusions (B. 433, p.
300):&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) In the stations of the pure Stone Age, brachycephalic skulls
only are known to a certainty to have existed.</p>

<p>(2) In the Transition period, both brachycephalic and
dolichocephalic are known.</p>

<p>(3) In the full Bronze period the skulls are more inclined to the
dolichocephalic type.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) The people of La Tène were of a highly mixed character,
among whom, however, brachycephalic types predominated.</p>

<p>The eminent Berlin anthropologist thinks that during the Bronze Age
a new people joined the original lake-dwellers by degrees, but not as
one great immigration subverting the previous order of things. This
opinion seems to be greatly strengthened by collateral circumstances.
We have already seen how gradually bronze was introduced among the
lake-dwellers. No violent disturbance of the previous conditions of
life is anywhere to be detected. The original system of constructing
lake-villages is continued exactly the same, and the only changes
are such as can be accounted for by the use of better implements.
The lake-dwellings of the Bronze Age are built in deeper water, and
consequently farther from the shore than those of the Stone Age, and
the piles are more slender, often stems split into two or four. The
steinbergs appear to have been discontinued, or were only used over a
hard and stony shore into which piles could not be easily driven. The
sites of the latest villages are on the same ground as, or in close
proximity to, those of the earliest ones. Remains of cottages are
still the same, viz. bits of plaster, with marks of round timbers,
and some hearth-stones. From Lake Bourget there are portions of clay
plaster of this character, ornamented with incised lines and the
impressions of groups of concentric circles (<b><a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a></b>, No. 15)
or the swastika (<b><a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a></b>, No. 12). Also from the same place
there are bits of clay tubes, the interiors of which are blackened
with soot, supposed to have been small chimneys (<b><a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a></b>, No. 8).</p>

<p>In Eastern Switzerland and the Danubian valley the number of
stations greatly decreased during the Bronze Age, while in the Lake of
Geneva they rather increased, and in Lake Bourget its eight stations
belonged almost exclusively to this period.</p>

<p>The stations at Laibach, the Mondsee, Attersee, and Schussenried
came to an end in the Transition period, and to the east of Lake
Constance only one, viz. that in the Starnbergersee, continued
during the Bronze Age. In the lakes of Constance, Zürich, Neuchâtel,
Morat, and Bienne, they were also greatly reduced in numbers; but,
on the other hand, they occupied larger areas, and show a greater
concentration to selected localities, often the outlets of the lakes.</p>

<p>It was not till 1876 that any sepulchral remains bearing on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
the question&mdash;how the lake-dwellers disposed of their
dead&mdash;came to light. In this year some workmen engaged in
digging the foundation for a house in the vicinity of the site of
the lake-dwelling at Auvernier, and some 50 yards from the shore,
came upon a large flagstone measuring 5&frac14; by 4&frac14; feet,
which turned out to be the covering of a stone coffin containing the
remains of 15 or 20 skeletons. The grave was constructed in the usual
way by setting four large flags on edge, which formed its sides, and
over them a fifth was laid as a covering. These upright flags were of
granite and gneiss, and the largest measured 6&frac14; feet long, 6
feet wide, and 11 inches thick. The rectangular space thus enclosed
measured 5 feet 3 inches long, 3 feet 8 inches wide, and 5 feet 10
inches deep. Dr. Gross, who superintended the clearing out of its
contents, states that the bodies had been placed in a sitting posture
round the grave, with the heads to the walls and the feet directed
towards the centre. External to this cist, on two of its sides,
there was another series of upright flags, which formed two smaller
chambers, and in one of them there were also human bones.</p>

<p>The relics associated with this burial consisted of some perforated
teeth (boar, bear, and wolf); a small polished bone disc, perforated
(<b><a href="#Fig_196">Fig. 196</a></b>, No. 3); two small stone celts&mdash;one
with a perforation for suspension in the end opposite the cutting edge. Of
bronze objects, found actually in the grave, there were only three,
viz. a plain pin 6&frac14; inches long (No. 1), a small ring (No. 6),
and a bead which looked like copper (No. 2).</p>

<p>Six feet to the east of this tomb, and about the same depth, the
workmen subsequently came upon the skeleton of a child buried simply
in the earth without any stone coffin, and near it were found the
following objects:&mdash;Two pairs of small oval bracelets (Nos. 4 and 5),
a curious pendant like a stud (No. 7), and an amber bead.</p>

<p>Two of the human skulls were sent to Rütimeyer, who pronounced them
to be of the <i>Type de Sion</i>, and identical with those he had already
examined from several lake-dwellings at Nidau, Meilen, Robenhausen, and Wauwyl.</p>

<p>From these data it would appear that the tomb of Auvernier belonged
to the Transition period. (B. 286.)</p>

<p>In 1876 and 1877 several interments were found near the quay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
at Montreux, some with, and some without, stone cists, and along with
them were associated various relics, as bracelets (Nos. 10 and 11),
hair-pins (Nos. 12 and 13), some pottery ornamented with geometrical
figures (No. 14), flint knives, a small stone crescent, and a horse's
tooth much smaller than those of our modern horse. (B. 336.) Again,
in 1884, some more tombs were discovered near the same place which
yielded objects of the Bronze Age, viz. a bronze pin, six bronze
bracelets (Nos. 8 and 9), and two or three urns (<i>Antiqua</i>, 1884, p. 101).</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. F. A. Forel (B. 286, p. 48) describes "cimetières de l'époque
lacustre" in the vicinity of Morges and St. Prex. In the former
group some skeletons were found in stone cists, one of which had two
bracelets still adhering to the bones. "Ces bracelets," says Dr.
Forel, "qui sont actuellement au musée cantonal de Lausanne, et à la
bibliothèque de Morges, appartiennent incontestablement par leur beau
travail et leur ornamentation riche et très-caractéristique à la belle
époque du Bronze, à l'époque de la grande cité de Morges." In the
cemetery near St. Prex were found some thirty skeletons deposited in
free earth, and associated with them were some bronze ornaments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
(une vingtaine de bracelets, épingles à cheveux, anneaux, etc.),
which, according to Dr. Forel, incontestably belonged to the <i>bel Age
du Bronze</i>. Moreover, in the very same place, and almost alternating
regularly with the free burials, there were urns containing ashes
and charcoal. One of these urns (still preserved at the date of
Dr. Forel's description, 1876), which measured 6&frac14; inches in
diameter and 5 inches in height, presented all the characters of the
pottery of the lake-dwellings of the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note here the association of the two modes
of burial in the same cemetery. That both systems were prevalent
in Switzerland, at least as far back as the Transition period, has
recently been shown by Mr. Heierli in his description of "Eine Gruppe
prähistorischer Gräber," and "Vorrömische Gräben im Kanton Zürich."
As the result of these investigations he proves that burnt bodies
were deposited under mounds, associated with clay vessels which were
ornamented with dots, lines, and string marks, precisely similar to
those on the vessels found at Vinelz.</p>

<p>As a further contribution to the subject, we have the prehistoric
graves at Chamblandes, near Pully, which, according to
the late Morel-Fatio, who describes them (B. 377),<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
belonged to the lake-dwellers of the Stone Age. It appears that a
cultivator, while digging the foundations of a house, came upon a
series of ancient graves, at a depth of six or seven feet, formed of
four flags set on edge, with a fifth as a covering. Along with each
skeleton were found 40 flakes of the tusks of the wild boar, pierced
at each extremity. In one a marine shell, also pierced by two holes,
was noted. In the following year further discoveries of similar graves
were made in the same place, and this time their contents were more
carefully examined. The sides were formed of four flags set on edge
with an additional one as a covering. On the average these cists
measured a mètre in length, and half this in breadth and depth, but
one or two of smaller dimensions were noted. When a single skeleton
was found it always lay with the feet towards the east. One, however,
contained four skeletons, and in this case the heads were in the four
corners. About the position of the breast some 40 doubly-perforated
boar's teeth were found, which must have been attached to the
garments. Besides these there were some perforated shells and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
two portions of colouring matter, one yellow and the other red.
Another tomb contained a complete skeleton, and on the neck lay
five doubly-perforated marine shells, while near the head were four
pieces of yellow and red colouring matter, and two amulets of human
skulls. Dispersed in this grave were beads which looked like amber,
but, according to some, were coral. One grave contained a spherical
hammer-stone, slightly flattened; another had a perforated and
beautifully made axe of serpentine, 6&frac12; inches long; and a
third, that of a child (27 inches by 13), had three small, flat, and
circular pebbles, like unperforated spindle-whorls, placed in the
form of a triangle, and at one of the corners of the grave were some
charcoal and fragments of burnt bones.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Morel-Fatio everything found in these graves
had their exact analogues in the early lake-dwellings such as
Chevroux. Not far off, at Pierra-Portay and Châtelard sur
Lutry, other burials of the Stone Age were discovered, which
also, in his opinion, belonged to the Lake-dwellers (<i>Lacustres</i>).</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;IRON AGE.</h3>

<p>In reviewing the salient features of the Iron Age we have still
more complicated problems to deal with. There are, in reality, no
lake-dwellings of the early Iron Age in Central Europe, showing a
Transition period, as we have seen to have been the case between the
Stone and Bronze Ages; nor, indeed, any which can be said to have
a continued sequence to the great system of pile-dwellings which
prevailed so extensively in earlier times. No doubt iron shows itself
in a few objects characteristic of the Bronze Age, such as a few
swords and bracelets encrusted with ornamental bands of this material,
but there are no tools or weapons made of iron at all analogous to
those which characterise the Bronze Age. No Transition period such
as we find in the relics from the graves at Hallstadt, where iron is
seen, as it were, competing with bronze. On the contrary, in the Swiss
lake-dwellings iron-working appears in a state of great perfection.
The few objects found on their sites are mostly of the La Tène type,
which we have seen to be entirely different in character, manufacture,
and style of ornamentation, from anything known in the previous ages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
In some stations we find not only La Tène types, but Roman tiles,
pottery, and coins, and even objects of a still later period, such as
Gallo-Roman, Allemanisch, and Merovingian remains. Thus, at Starnberg,
we have of iron, two spear-heads, a horseshoe, and a remarkable kind
of knife (<b><a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a></b>, No. 1). In the investigations
conducted during the winter of 1864-5 in the Überlingersee, Dr. Lachmann
records the following iron objects from the bronze station of
Unter-Uhldingen:&mdash;one lance-head, five arrow-points, one axe, two
chisels, 12 knife-blades, two sickle-like objects, one dagger-knife,
one ring, one triangular plate with attached ring, one fibula, one
pin, part of a two-edged sword, a short sword with a wooden handle,
a fork, a stamp, a pair of pincers, etc.&mdash;in all 40 objects.
Also at Sipplingen there were three arrow-heads, two sickles, one
lance-head, a one-edged sword, and a Roman key. In the Museum at
Friedrichshafen are several objects of iron taken from Uhldingen,
viz. two knives like pruning-hooks (<i>hippen</i>), a hammer-hatchet,
a fibula (La Tène) 9 inches long, two harpoons, several arrow-heads,
six horseshoes, one dagger, and a girdle-hook. Still more interesting
are fragments of fine glass found on both these stations, as well as
at the Rauenegg in the Bay of Constance. One bit of this glass, of a
grey greenish colour, had been ornamented with gold enamel. According
to the opinion of Mr. Hofrath Klemm, of Dresden, this glass belongs to
the sixth or seventh century. (B. 378.)</p>

<p>In Lake Zürich on the station of Grosser Hafner were found an iron
spear-head like those from La Tène, Roman tiles, and pottery of the
kind known as terra sigillata, and coins of the time of Augustus,
Tiberias, and Vespasian, etc., thus bringing the station down to
the end of the first century of the Christian era. From Nidau and
Sutz there are some curious iron spear-heads, and from Chevroux a
three-pronged harpoon identical with analogous objects from La Tène
(<b><a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a></b>, No. 15). Moeringen has yielded an iron
horse-bit, an iron sword (La Tène), a curious iron fork, etc. On the south
side of St. Peter's Island, in the Lake of Bienne, Colonel Schwab found among
some piles objects of the stone, bronze, and Gallo-Roman periods,
together with 40 Roman coins. From the same place there is in the
Berne Museum an iron hatchet with a wooden handle of the La Tène type
(<b><a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a></b>). On several stations in Lake Neuchâtel
similar objects have occasionally turned up. In Lake Morat iron objects and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
Roman remains were found at Greing, Faoug, Guevaux, and Motier. Also
a knife, the blade of which was partly of iron and partly of bronze
(<b><a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a></b>, No. 1).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_197" id="Fig_197"></a>
  <img src="images/i_584_a.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="277" />
  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 197</b>.&mdash;Iron Axe
with portion of Wooden Handle (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>).</p>
</div>

<p>Iron objects have also been occasionally found on a few stations
in the Lake of Geneva, as at Plongeon and Morges; from the latter of
which Dr. Forel records a number of sickles of various forms, some
of which were like those of La Tène. In Lake Bourget a knife with a
bronze handle and an iron blade (International Congress, Paris, p.
266), and a piece of pottery with the name <i>Severinus</i> stamped on it.
(B. 176, p. 24.) In the Museum of Chambery there is a large spear-head
of iron encrusted with broad lines of copper or bronze from this lake
(<b><a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a></b>) which is very similar to one
found near the Pont de la Thiele.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_198" id="Fig_198"></a>
  <img src="images/i_584_b.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="144" />
  <p class="center space-below1"><b>Fig. 198</b>.&mdash;Iron Spear
ornamented with Bronze (about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>).</p>
</div>

<p>But in all these instances the occurrence of iron is so exceptional
that only probable deductions can be founded on them. Most of the iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
objects have undoubtedly the same origin as those of La Tène. The rare
bronze objects with encrusted iron bands, such as a few bracelets
(Moeringen, Auvernier, Cortaillod, and Corcelettes), and one or two
swords (Moeringen), need not cause surprise when we remember the
extent to which commercial intercourse seems to have been carried on
by the lake-dwellers with eastern nations; and that both iron and
bronze were in use in Greece at least 1,200 years before the Christian
era, while in Egypt and Central Asia these metals were known some
1,500 years earlier. Between those objects in which iron is used as an
ornament (all of which are of the same style as the bronze objects),
and the La Tène weapons, there is a wide gap which is not bridged over
by any relics found in the lake-dwellings. In short, the evolutionary
stage between the smelting of bronze and the forging of iron is here
represented by a corresponding <i>hiatus</i> between the styles of art
of the two periods more striking than that which distinguishes the
neolithic from palæolithic industrial remains.</p>

<p>So far as I have looked into these matters I can only conclude
that, with the introduction of iron into general use in Switzerland,
we have a new people who conquered and subjugated the lake-dwellers
and gave the death-blow to their system of lake-villages. Henceforth
these villages fell into decay, and in the general destruction which
ensued these La Tène implements might have been introduced by the
invaders. In Roman times there remained only the ruins of a few
stations. One thing is clearly established, that the conquerors of
the lake-dwellers had a full knowledge of the working of iron in all
its phases. The important point here is not the date of the discovery
of this metal, but that of its application to the manufacture of
all weapons and cutting implements. It is not likely that an art so
complicated and requiring so much metallurgical and technical skill
as that of the smelting and forging of iron had a sudden origin; and
consequently we must look for its birthplace and evolutionary stages
elsewhere. The remarkable collection of weapons, implements, and
ornaments found at La Tène, to which I specially directed attention in
a previous lecture, gives us a striking picture of the metallurgical
skill to which their owners had attained prior to any influences
from Roman art. So important are these antiquities considered
by archæologists that the name La Tène has now become a generic
expression, and represents a special group which, both in form
and style of ornamentation, cannot be confounded with any other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
either Greek, Roman, Etruscan or Ph&oelig;nician. Who were these
new comers into Switzerland who so suddenly intruded themselves on
the peaceful lake-dwellers? To this question there is no response
from the skulls and other portions of human skeletons found at La
Tène. Out of ten skulls submitted to Professor Virchow he found that
five were brachycephalic and two dolichocephalic, while the other
three had intermediate cranial indices. We must therefore fall back
on the character of the antiquities; and for this purpose I place
before you some typical examples of this remarkable group
(<b><a href="#Fig_199">Fig. 199</a></b>) culled from various sources for the purpose
of showing their complete identity with those from the oppidum La Tène. Having
satisfied ourselves on this point I proceed to glance rapidly over the
geographical area in which such objects are found, with the view of
showing to what people they belonged.</p>

<p>In the course of making the high-road from Berne to the bridge of
Tiefenau in 1849-50 the workmen came upon a large quantity of weapons
and implements of iron which, though very much rusted and decayed,
can be clearly identified as belonging to the La Tène group. These
objects, now preserved in the Museum at Berne, consist of the <i>débris</i>
of arms, coats of mail, chariots, bridle-bits, bones of horses,
pottery fine and coarse, some thirty pieces of money (<i>massaliotes et
celtiques</i>), glass beads, iron and bronze buttons, sickles, knives,
hatchets, etc. These objects, which were all mixed together in a
miscellaneous manner, some two or three feet below the surface, had no
appearance of ordinary burial, and are therefore considered to be the
huddled up <i>débris</i> of a battle-field. The objects, so far as they can
be made out, are described and figured by Baron de Bonstetten in his
"Supplément au Recueil d'Antiquités Suisses, 1860," and "Notice sur
les Armes et Chariots de Guerre découverts à Tiefenau, 1851."

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
During the excavations for the "Correction des Eaux du Jura," some
remarkable discoveries were made, especially while deepening and
rectifying the lower Thielle between Nidau and Meyenried. Immediately
below the village of Port the <i>débris</i> of a pile-village was
encountered, to which I have already alluded. Above this village the
dredgers came in contact with a row of piles which Dr. v. Fellenberg
concluded to have been the supports of a bridge. These piles were
from 8 to 12 inches thick, and near them were collected over 100
weapons of the La Tène types, including swords, spears, etc. Another
locality was a little below Brügg, where traces of two bridges were
encountered, one of the Gallo-Roman period and the other supposed to
be of later date. Near the former a large collection of antiquities
was made, including objects, not only of the La Tène type, but also
others of Etruscan and Roman origin. Amongst the La Tène objects
collected during these operations are swords and sheaths (one of the
latter being of bronze), spear-heads, axes, sickles, etc., which are
identical with those figured from La Tène. One of the spear-heads is
ornamented with incised lines producing two designs, one on the right
side of each surface, as shown in <b><a href="#Fig_199">Fig. 199</a></b>, No. 7.</p>

<p>In France similar antiquities have been collected on the
Helvetico-Romano battle-fields, such as Alise St. Renne (Alesia of
Cæsar), and Mont Beuvray (Bibracte), as well as in some graves in
northern France, particularly in the valleys of the Marne and the
Aube. Some of these graves were evidently the final resting place
of Gaulish chiefs, and contained in addition to the body a complete
suite of military equipments. For comparison I have given here some
illustrations of these discoveries. No. 1 represents the famous bronze
helmet known as the Casque de Berru, described by Bertrand, which is
particularly interesting on account of the ornamental designs which
it displays.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
No. 2 is a similar helmet ornamented with a kind of fretwork, and
along with it in the same grave were a great many objects, weapons,
ornaments, the bronze mountings of horses' harness, and
the <i>débris</i> of a chariot.<a name="FNanchor_147_147"
id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147"
class="fnanchor">[147]</a> A few of these are here illustrated, viz.
an iron spear (No. 8), a sword and its sheath both of iron (No. 16),
two bronze fibulæ (Nos. 10 and 11), a gold bracelet (No. 13), a bronze
horse-bit (No. 12), and some specimens of mountings for a chariot
(Nos. 14 and 15), and harness (No. 9).</p>

<p>Characteristic finds of this period have also been found in Savoy,
the Alpine Passes, and North Italy. In the Museums of Bologna,
Este, Milan, Turin, etc., are deposited the contents of numerous
warrior-graves, which show unmistakable examples of the characteristic
swords and scabbards and other objects of La Tène civilisation. Its
central home, however, appears to have been the middle and upper Rhine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
districts, Baden, Bavaria, and eastwards to Bohemia and Laibach.
Northwards sporadic examples are found as far as the Baltic.</p>

<p>One of the most important finds of this character in Europe
was discovered, investigated, and described some ten years ago.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Near the village Stradonic in Bohemia there is a truncated eminence
known under the name "der Berg Hradischt," which, owing to the
precipitous nature of its slopes, is only accessible on one side. By
nature this rocky eminence is admirably adapted for a military camping
place, and that it was occupied in such a capacity in prehistoric
times is evident from the mass of industrial remains of all ages found
at various depths on its summit. Among these, however, by far the
largest number were of the La Tène type, including a large quantity
of money precisely similar to that found on La Tène. Gold pieces were
particularly numerous, some 200 being found in one place. Others were
of silver and potin, some imitating the coins of Philip of Macedon,
and others bearing impressions of the fantastic horse with the long
tail and horn (<b><a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a></b>, Nos. 5 to 8). Roman coins
were also present, but very sparingly. Among industrial and ornamental remains
were fragments of glass bracelets of a yellow, blue, or red colour
(Nos. 3 and 4), pincers, torques, grotesque figures of animal heads,
iron axes, bridle-bits, etc. Upwards of 100 dice pieces of bone (Nos.
17 and 18). The characteristic fibulæ were of iron and bronze, the
former, however, predominating. I have here placed side by side two
bronze fibulæ precisely alike except in dimensions, one (No. 5) being
from La Tène and the other (No. 6) from Hradischt. The former is after
Vouga (B. 428, Pl. xvi. 17), who describes it as of the Hallstadt
type, and probably of an older date than the ordinary La Tène objects.
The presence of two objects so similar in style and ornamentation
in such distant localities not only proves that they are forms of
fibulæ then prevalent, but also becomes a striking confirmation of
the contemporaneity of oppidum La Tène and the occupation of the camp
on Hradischt. That they were the same people who occupied both places
there can be little doubt.</p>

<p>The repeated incursions of the Gauls into North Italy, prior
to its conquest by the Romans, so often referred to in classical
writers, have been strikingly confirmed by recent archæological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
researches. In the cemeteries of Benacci, Villanova, and Marzabotto,
in the vicinity of Bologna, the Gallic element has been for some
time recognised by many of the most competent archæologists. During
the excavations at Benacci three series of graves were observed, at
different depths, the contents of which clearly prove that they were
the cemeteries of different races. The first, or uppermost, were
burials of the Roman period. Underneath them was a group of twelve
graves which, from the long iron swords and characteristic fibulæ
found along with the bodies, are now universally accepted as Celtic or
Gaulish. Below these, again, was a third group which in every respect
corresponded with the Etruscan cemetery of Villanova.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
Helbig assigns the date of the Celtic graves at Marzabotto to
the end of the fifth or beginning of the fourth century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (B. 335, p. 35.)</p>

<p>In 1878 Castelfranco investigated a cemetery at Soldo, in the
Brianza district, in which, among other things, he found the following
relics:&mdash;A bronze fibula and an iron knife, precisely similar to
those here figured from the Starnberg lake-dwelling (<b><a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a></b>,
No. 22, and <b><a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a></b>, No. 1); an iron shears like those from La
Tène: a Celtic silver coin; a vase with the word VITILIOS scratched on
it in rude <i>graffiti</i>, which Fabretti ascribes to a Celtic source
("La direi celtica per la desinenza, come pure per la forma del T").
See B. 343, pp. 6 to 28, and Pl. i.</p>

<p>More recently (1886) the same author described several groups of
cemeteries scattered over Lombardy, particularly on the left side
of the Po, in which he found characteristic examples of the La Tène
civilisation&mdash;swords, spears, knives, fibulæ, saws, shears, nodulated
rings, etc.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>During the earlier discoveries of objects of this peculiar phase
of art there was considerable diversity of opinion as to the people
and period to which they should be referred. The Tiefenau "find" was
assigned by Mr. Albert Jahn to the old Helvetians ("Canton Bern"),
while Baron de Bonstetten referred it to the German races who invaded
Helvetia in the fourth century. M. Veschère de Reffye, in describing
the discoveries at the ancient fortress of Alesia, assigned the
weapons found in the trenches, which turned out to be of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
character as those of La Tène, to the Helvetians.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Acting on this suggestion, Desor expressed the opinion that the
La Tène iron weapons and other implements were introduced into
Switzerland by the Helvetians, who hailed from Germany, and entered
the country as conquerors. Dr. Keller, apparently prejudiced by his
preconceived notion that the lake-dwellings of the Stone and Bronze
Ages were due to the Celts, had a difficulty in believing that the
advanced civilisation of La Tène was a direct evolutionary product of
the Bronze Age; but yet he would not agree with the opinion that these
civilisations indicated different races.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most important contribution to the subject was
by Mr. Franks,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
who demonstrated by an analysis of the style of ornamentation,
together with an array of historical references bearing on the customs
of the ancient Celtic races, that to them alone must be assigned
the remarkable remains now in question. The few additional notices
of later discoveries here introduced only strengthen this opinion.
In my investigations of the British lake-dwellings, almost the only
instance in which analogous remains have come to light is the "find"
at Lisnacroghera; but the prevalence of such antiquities in Britain
from about the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> till
the introduction of Christianity, when the spiral and trumpet-shaped
ornamentation became modified, and to a considerable extent
superseded, by the addition of interlacements, has been so fully
established by Mr. Franks that on this point nothing remains to be said.</p>

<p>From these remarks you see that we are among the class of
antiquities (described and illustrated in "Horæ Ferales") to which
Mr. Franks has given the name "Late Celtic." The owners of these La
Tène weapons in Switzerland were the Helvetians, of Roman celebrity,
who, according to Cæsar, were a branch of the great Celtic family
who so long dominated over the rest of the Aryan races, and whose
civilisation is only now in its death struggle in the outlying
districts of Western Europe. Who these Celts were is a question which
still puzzles historians, philologists, and archæologists. The term
"Late Celtic" is sufficiently clear, and, as we have seen, accurately
defines a most remarkable group of antiquities; but it necessarily
involves a counterpart, viz. an "Early Celtic" period, in regard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
which no archæologist has offered any opinion beyond mere conjecture.
Before my rambles among the ruins and relics of the lacustrine
villages I had no reason to doubt the correctness of the opinion
advanced and promulgated by the late Dr. Keller, viz. that the
early lake-dwellers belonged to the Celtic race. I do not think
that archæology supports this opinion. If the "Late Celtic" relics
correctly represent the Celts of that period they must have been a
large-bodied race, wielding great swords with massive grips, totally
out of keeping with the small-handed weapons of the Bronze Age
as found on the sites of the lake-dwellings. The few indications
derived from the data supplied by lake-dwelling research suggest
the idea that the evolution of the Celts in Europe coincides with
the substitution of iron for bronze in the manufacture of the more
important cutting implements and weapons, and that the earlier stages
of this transition are to be found considerably to the east of the
Rhine districts&mdash;as, for example, at Hallstadt.</p>

<p>In hazarding an opinion as to the original founders of the
lake-dwellings in Central Europe I would say that they were part
of the first neolithic immigrants who entered the country by the
regions surrounding the Black Sea and the shore of the Mediterranean,
and spread westwards along the Danube and its tributaries till
they reached the great central lakes. Here they founded that
remarkable system of lake-villages whose ruins and relics are now
being disinterred as it were from another or forgotten world.
Those following the Drave and the Save entered Styria, where they
established their settlements on what was then a great lake at
Laibach. From this they crossed the mountains to the Po valley,
where they founded not only the pile-villages, but subsequently the
terremare. The Danubian wanderers having reached the upper sources of
the Danube, crossed the uplands by way of Schussenried, and arrived
on the shores of Lake Constance, from which they quickly spread over
the low-lying districts of Switzerland. From Lake Neuchâtel, still
continuing a westward course, they reached the Rhone valley by way
of Morges, where they erected one of their earliest and largest
settlements. From the Lake of Geneva they had easy access to the
lakes of Annecy and Bourget.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that almost the only historical notices
of the habit of constructing lake-dwellings which have come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
down to us refer to districts along this supposed route. The following
quotation from Herodotus (v. 16) gives a vivid description of a
lake-village which flourished some 500 years before Christ. The Lake
Prasias here referred to is situated in the south of Roumelia, not far
from the mouth of the river Strymon, and the rather remarkable fact
which is here recorded shows that its lake-dwellers were so powerful
as to successfully defy the resources of a Persian army.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"They, on the other hand, who dwelt about Mount Pangæum and in the
country of the Doberes, the Agrianians and the Odomantians, and
they likewise who inhabited Lake Prasias, were not conquered by
Megabazus. He sought, indeed, to subdue the dwellers upon the lake,
but could not effect his purpose. Their manner of living is the
following:&mdash;Platforms supported upon tall piles stand in the
middle of the lake, which are approached from the land by a single
narrow bridge. At the first the piles which bear up the platforms were
fixed in their places by the whole body of the citizens; but since
that time the custom which prevails about fixing them is this: they
are brought from a hill called Orbelus, and every man drives in three
for each wife that he marries. Now the men have all many wives apiece,
and this is the way in which they live. Each has his own hut, wherein
he dwells, upon one of the platforms; and each has also a trap door
giving access to the lake beneath; and their wont is to tie their baby
children by the foot with a string, to save them from rolling into the
water. They feed their horses and their other beasts on fish, which
abound in the lake to such a degree that a man has only to open his
trap-door and to let down a basket by a rope into the water, and then
to wait a very short time, when up he draws it quite full of them."</p>

<p>Another reference to lake-dwellings occurs in a passage by
Hippocrates ("De Æribus," etc., xxxvii.), and the locality to which
the remarks were applied lies to the east of the Black Sea.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Concerning the people of the Phasis, that region is marshy and hot,
and full of water, and woody; and at every season frequent and violent
rains fall there. The inhabitants live in the marshes, and have houses
of timber and of reeds constructed in the midst of the waters; and
they seldom go out to the city or the market, but sail up and down in
boats made out of a single tree-trunk, for there are numerous canals
in that region. The water they drink is hot and stagnant, putrefied
by the sun, and swollen by the rainfall, and the Phasis itself is the
most stagnant and quiet-flowing of all rivers."</p>

<p>In the works of recent travellers I find statements corroborating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
the opinion already published by Dr. Keller (B. 119, 2nd ed., p. 666),
that the remains of lake-dwellings have been detected in Asia Minor,
more especially in the Caucasus and the region between the Black Sea
and the Caspian. As early as 1849 Bayern discovered palafittes in
Lake Gok-chai and in Lake Paleostrum, not far from the embouchure of
the Rion (Phasis). Mr. Chantre states that on the lowering of Lake
Toporovan, near the village of Choucha at the embouchure of the Koura,
and in some other lakes on the coast of the Black Sea, indications of
their existence have been observed.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
None of these have, however, been sufficiently explored to be of
archæological value.</p>

<p>While the lake-dwellers of Switzerland were quietly living in
the peculiar habitations which the hydrographical conditions of the
country enabled them to develop so largely, great and progressive
changes were going on elsewhere among the neolithic settlers in
Europe. Probably other immigrants soon found their way to the far
west, and brought with them a knowledge of bronze. As time rolled on,
considerable divergences from the primitive civilisation took place,
partly the outcome of geographical and climatal conditions, and partly
the result of innovations by freer intercourse with the inhabitants
of the shores of the Mediterranean. Then were laid gradually the
germs of the historical nationalities of Europe. Just at the dawn of
history we find the Celts, not in the sunshine of their power, but
with faded strength and departed glory, confined to a limited area
in Europe. After the collapse of the great lake-villages it is not
singular to find that a knowledge of the system remained among the
surrounding nationalities which subsequently germinated into activity
in various sporadic corners, and produced not only the Scottish and
Irish crannogs, but the analogous remains in Friesland, North Germany,
Paladru, etc. As the great extinct mammals are known to have lingered
in the recesses of mountain ranges and other secluded localities, so
the artificial islands or crannogs and other lake-habitations of the
Iron Age are but the deteriorated remnants of a doomed system which,
like every dying art before final extinction, passed through a stage
of decay and degeneration.

This mould is in two parts, and it is remarkable as
having been found at different times. The first half was found by
Mr. F. A. Forel on the 25th of February, 1855, and the second by
his son, Dr. Forel, on the 18th of October, 1859. (B. 31, p. 111.)</p></div>

Contained three or four crannogs. "In the one opposite Cloncahir were found
several querns of different sizes and patterns (chiefly flat-shaped, ornamented with
the usual cross design, varied more or less), and many of these were taken away by
Mr. Kane to preserve at Mohill Castle. When the water was at a low level a slight
examination was made in regard to the construction of the crannog. It was found
that there were two, possibly three, concentric circles of piles of small size, enclosing
an area considerably larger than that of the present island, and the space so enclosed
seemed to have been filled with rough unhewn logs of wood up to about the present
summer level of the water. Upon this had been deposited a stratum of stones and
gravel, amongst which were found the querns already mentioned. In the same
lake are three other crannogs&mdash;Man Island, Crane Island, and another."</p></div>

Among the objects from Lagore mentioned by Lord Talbot (<b>Fig.
103</b>) is a peculiar iron pipe, described as of unknown use. It is
rather remarkable that it and this bayonet-like object from Buston
should be the counterparts of a kind of padlock in use in the earlier
Middle Ages, which acted in the following manner:&mdash;When a
spring-bolt (like that of the object from Buston) was passed through
the tube upwards, the spike attached to the latter passed through
the perforation in the former. Inside the tube there were two small
prominences, which when the bolt was pushed sufficiently home caught
the tips of its springs and prevented its return. In this state the
padlock was securely locked, and it could only be opened by a key
consisting of another but smaller tube, which, when passed through the
other end of the larger tube and over the springs, pressed the latter
close to the body of the bolt until their tips became clear of the
internal catches, and so allowed the spring-bolt to be extracted.</p></div>

The question of submarine crannogs is still obscure, and the few facts
that have come to light leave the matter in doubt as to whether the
structures were originally constructed in the water or on dry land
and subsequently submerged, in consequence of changes in the relative
levels of sea and land. The only remains of this character that I
know of in Britain are&mdash;(1) a cairn of stones on a substratum
of wood near the island of Eriska, at the mouth of Loch Crerar; (2)
the Black Cairn, in the Beauly Firth; and (3) some stumps of piles in
Ardmore Bay, county Waterford. The mound at Eriska, which was found
on examination to be of circular shape and 60 feet in diameter, was
dry at low water, but submerged at spring-tides to the extent of five
feet. Some ashes and charcoal and the broken bones of sheep and small
oxen were the only relics of human occupancy found. The Black Cairn
is noticed in the Statistical Account of Scotland, and also by Miss
Maclagan. It is about four hundred yards within flood-mark. The top is
only visible at low water, and the base is said to be composed of very
large wooden beams.</p></div>

Mr. Wallace describes the island as entirely artificial, "raised
upon piles and cross-beams, about fifty yards from the shore,
and 189 feet long, with an average of 112 feet wide. The water
immediately surrounding it is deep, and the margin of the island rises
perpendicularly from the deep water, which is about seven or eight
feet deep on the north and east sides, and ten or twelve feet on
the south and west. The piles and cross-beams, on which it has been
raised, lie like a pavement all round it, inclining to the centre.
The beams are of oak, pine, and birch. Those of pine and oak are the
largest. Between the beams, and all over the island, numerous pieces
of charcoal were picked up. The island rises in the centre, and, after
clearing away part of the luxuriant nettles and long grass, portions
of a walled structure were disclosed. No trace of lime-cement could
be detected, but the stones were large and well placed together. The
ruins of this building raised the island to the height of seven feet
above the present water-mark." The island is noticed in the historical
annals, and in 1596 gave refuge to the Earl of Arran. The occurrence
of vitrified materials on the surface gives to this crannog, according
to Mr. Wallace, peculiar interest. I could understand this interest
had it been proved that vitrified buildings had been constructed
over the crannog. In the construction of the crannog, of course,
stones taken from the shore were used, and in this way the vitrified
materials might be accounted for, or, what is more probable, they
are the slag of a smelting furnace. The following are Mr. Wallace's
words: "I visited the island in July, 1885, and scarcely had I set my
foot on shore when I found a small piece of true vitrified rock; and
great was my astonishment when I discovered that the whole island was
covered with fragments of different sizes of the same material. It was
found among the piles and cross-beams in great quantities. Several
larger masses&mdash;one measuring four feet by three&mdash;were found
on the western margin of the island, and deeply embedded among the
stones and above the piles and cross-beams, close to the water's
edge. After careful examination the vitrified material was found to
differ in no way from that forming our vitrified forts. Between the
crannog and the shore there is a smaller island of large stones, which
is only visible when the loch is exceptionally low, as it was this
season. This island, which measures 90 feet by 60 feet, appears to be
entirely built of stones. The sides, like those of the larger island,
are perpendicular. One piece of vitrified rock was found here. The
distance between the islands is about sixty feet, and between the
smaller one and the shore about twenty feet."</p></div>

Upon the partial drainage of Carlingwark Loch, in 1765,
various kinds of artificial structures were observed, as wooden
roadways, dams built of stone and clay, and a couple of islets
constructed on a framework of black oak. In the mud were also found
various relics, as a brass dagger, 22 inches long, mounted with gold
plaiting; a brass pan; a remarkable cauldron (<a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>),
containing bronze and iron implements; and several large stag-heads.</p></div>

"In draining a lake at the east end of the parish of Croy, an
artificial mound appeared within a few yards of the shore, about sixty
feet in circumference and five in height. It was formed of alternate
strata of stones, earth, and oak; piles of oak being driven in the
ground were kept strongly fixed by transverse beams of smaller size.
Over these were round stones, and on the surface some inches of fine
black mould. Some fragments of brass rings, pieces of pottery, and
the bolt of a lock of no ordinary size, were found on the mound. At
about a hundred yards distance there is a circle of large piles of
oak, driven deep in the earth, apparently the commencement of a second
mound; but for what purpose they were intended it is impossible to
conjecture. At the same time a canoe, of most beautiful workmanship,
was found, which some modern Goth has since cut down for mean and
servile purposes."</p></div>

Rev. R. J. Mapleton thus sums up his observations:&mdash;"Altogether,
I think that it is evident that the crannog was entirely composed of
rock and walling, with the middle part filled up with smaller stones;
that there existed considerable works of wood on the east, south, and
west sides, at least, but whether a rampart outside or a building on
the structure itself, is not quite clear; that there was a partial
causeway, now under water, and the interval either filled in with
brushwood or passed over in a canoe."</p></div>

Half a century ago Loch Leven was lowered nine feet by drainage, and
at the present time the remains of the lake-dwelling are always from
one to three feet under water. The mound measures 35 yards by 20
yards, and 1&frac12; to 2 feet in height. In this area were detected
the stumps of two rows of piles, twelve feet apart, and each pile was
four or five feet apart. Also, in a line stretching to the shore,
which is about sixty yards distant, there were one or two piles
encountered, as if forming part of a gangway. The lake-bottom is here
firm, and not liable to compression, so that the structure, whether
ancient or modern, was really a pile-building. The only relics are a
bit of carved wood, which might have been a handle, and a fragment of
archaic-like pottery.</p></div>

Dr. Stuart quotes the following account of a crannog in Loch Lochy
from Mr. Robertson's notes, extracted by the latter from a MS. in
the Advocate's Library, written towards the end of the seventeenth
century: "Ther was of ancient ane lord in Loquhaber, called my Lord
Cumming, being a cruell and tyirrant superior to the inhabitants and
ancient tenants of that countrie of Loquhaber. This lord builded ane
iland, or an house, on the south-east head of Loghloghae; ... and when
summer is, certain yeares or dayes, one of the bigge timber jests, the
quantitie of an ell thereof will be sein above the water. And sundrie
men of the countrie were wont to goe and se that jest of timber which
stands there as yett; and they say that a man's finger will cast it
too and fro in the water, but fortie men cannot pull it up, because it
lyeth in another jest below the water." B. 94, p. 160.</p></div>

The relics from the Wigtownshire crannogs, besides
those already mentioned, are not numerous. From Barlockhart there
is a stone ring (<b><a href="#Fig_175">Fig. 175</a></b>), two querns, and a spindle-whorl
of clay-slate. From one of the crannogs at Machermore Loch there
is a stone implement, with circular hollows on each face (<b><a href="#Fig_175">Fig. 175</a></b>).
Regarding such implements Rev. George Wilson writes
thus:&mdash;"These are of two types, elongated and oval, approaching a
circular form, and I wish to direct attention to them because, as
yet [1879], only eight have been reported in Scotland, seven of them
being from Wigtownshire" (<i>Proc. S. A. Scot.</i>, vol. xiv. p. 127).
Shortly afterwards another, described at <a href="#Page_422">page 422</a>, was
found on the crannog of Lochspouts, in Ayrshire.</p></div>

Lochavoullin, situated to the east of the Oban railway station, was
formerly, as the name implies, used as a dam for a water-mill, but for
many years it was a marsh in the summer time, and much frequented by
sportsmen on account of the number of snipes which it sheltered. It is
now in the process of being utilised, partly as a green, by filling
up its bed, and partly as a skating-pond; and in the course of these
operations a submerged platform of wooden beams, laid in transverse
layers, was detected about the centre of the marsh. I visited the
locality in the spring of 1888, but beyond seeing portions of the
woodwork, and determining, by probing the mud, that it extended for
several yards in all directions, nothing of archæological value was
discovered. So far, however, it has all the appearance of the usual
crannog, an opinion which is strengthened by the physical conditions
of the environment.</p></div>

This loch covers about two acres. At the north end there is a small
island, covered with a rank vegetation and a few stunted trees of
Scottish fir and birch. A rough, crooked causeway extended from it to
the shore. "Round the island could be seen driven piles, to which were
attached strong transverse beams, and upon making a cut six or seven
feet wide into the side of the island to ascertain its structure, we
found a platform of about four feet in depth, raised by transverse
beams placed alternately across each other, and kept in position by
driven piles. These last were generally small oak trees, but dressed
and sharpened by a metal tool, some of them mortised at the heads,
where a transverse rail or beam could be fixed."</p></div>

While visiting Mr. Flinders Petrie's collection of antiquities from
Egypt lately exhibited in London, I was much interested in seeing
a well-shaped wooden sickle with a groove in which a flint saw was
still cemented in its place. The groove is adapted for three such
saws, but only one remained in its place. The wooden portion of
this unique instrument is shaped like a modern corn-hook, with the
exception that the handle turns downwards at a right angle to the
cutting plane, and the opposite end runs out into a long sharp point.
It measures 12&frac12; inches from tip to tip, and 17 from the point
to the most bulging part of the body. From the same place were various
other flint implements and some semilunar knives or saws, precisely
similar to those so common in the Scandinavian archæological area.
Mr. Petrie also pointed out some flint objects which were undoubtedly
an imitation of implements of copper and bronze with which they were
associated. The tombs of Hawara in which these relics were discovered
are said to be of the 12th dynasty, dating some 2,600 years B.C.</p></div>
